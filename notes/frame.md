# Web frameworks

Web frameworks seek to make the job of writing web applications easier by providing tools for completing common application tasks. This includes things like modularizing code, creating single page applications, simplifying reactivity, and supporting diverse hardware devices.

Some frameworks take things beyond the standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and create new hybrid file formats that combine things like HTML and JavaScript into a single file. Examples of this include React JSX, Vue SFC, and Svelte files. Abstracting away the core web file formats puts the focus on functional components rather than files.

There are lots of web frameworks to choose from and they evolve all the time. You can view the latest popularity poll at [StateOfJS](https://stateofjs.com).

Each framework has advantages and disadvantages. Some are very perscriptive (opinionated) about how to do things, some have major institutional backing, others have a strong open source community. Other factors you want to consider include how easy it is to learn, how it impacts productivity, how performant it is, how long it takes to build, and how actively the framework is evolving.

## Hello world examples

For our classwork we will use the web framework React. However, before we dig into React let's look at how the major frameworks would render a simple hello world application.

### Vue

[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a single file. HTML is represented by a `template` element that can be aggregated into other templates.

**SFC**

```html
<script>
  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        name: 'world',
      };
    },
  };
</script>

<style>
  p {
    color: green;
  }
</style>

<template>
  <p>Hello {{ name }}!</p>
</template>
```

### Svelte

Like Vue, [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a single file. The difference here is that Svelte requires a transpiler to generate browser ready code, instead of a runtime virtual DOM.

**Svelte file**

```html
<script>
  let name = 'world';
</script>

<style>
  p {
    color: green;
  }
</style>

<p>Hello {name}!</p>
```

### React

React combines JavaScript and HTML into its component format. CSS must be declared outside of the JSX file. The component itself highly leverages the functionality of JavaScript and can be represented as a function or class.

**JSX**

```jsx
import 'hello.css';

const Hello = () => {
  let name = 'world';

  return <p>Hello {name}</p>;
};
```

**CSS**

```css
p {
  color: green;
}
```

### Angular component

An Angular component defines what JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are combined together. This keeps a fairly strong separation of files what are usually grouped together in a directory rather than using the single file representation.

**JS**

```js
@Component({
  selector: 'app-hello-world',
  templateUrl: './hello-world.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./hello-world.component.css'],
})
export class HelloWorldComponent {
  name: string;
  constructor() {
    this.name = 'world';
  }
}
```

**HTML**

```html
<p>hello {{name}}</p>
```

**CSS**

```css
p {
  color: green;
}
```

# React

React, and its associated projects, provide a powerful web programming framework. The name React comes from its focus on making reactive web page components that automatically update based on user interactions or changes in the underlying data.

![Jordan Walke](jordanWalke.jpg)

React was created by Jordan Walke for use at FaceBook in 2011. It was first used with FaceBook's news feed and then as the main framework for Instagram. Shortly thereafter, FaceBook open sourced the framework and it was quickly adopted by many popular web applications.

React abstracts HTML into a JavaScript variate called [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). JSX is converted into valid HTML and JavaScript using a preprocessor called [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). For example, the following is a JSX file. Notice that it mixes both HTML and JavaScript into a single representation.

```jsx
const i = 3;
const list = (
  <ol class='big'>
    <li>Item {i}</li>
    <li>Item {3 + i}</li>
  </ol>
);
```

Babel will convert that into valid JavaScript:

```js
const i = 3;
const list = React.createElement(
  'ol',
  { class: 'big' },
  React.createElement('li', null, 'Item ', i),
  React.createElement('li', null, 'Item ', 3 + i)
);
```

The `React.createElement` function will then generate DOM elements and monitor the data they represent for changes. When a change is discovered React will trigger dependent changes.

# Components

React components allow you to modularize the functionality of your application. This allows the underlying code to directly represent the components that a user interacts with. It also enables code reuse as common application component often show up repeatedly.

## The render function

One of the primary purposes of a component is to generate user interface. This is done with the components `render` function. Whatever is returned from the render function is inserted into the component HTML element.

As a simple example, a JSX file containing a React component element named `Demo` would cause React to load the `Demo` component, call the render function, and insert the result into the place of the `Demo` element.

**JSX**

```jsx
<div>
  Component: <Demo />
</div>
```

Notice that `Demo` is not a valid HTML element. The transpiler will replace this tag with the resulting rendered HTML.

**React component**

```js
function Demo() {
  const who = 'world';
  return <b>Hello {who}</b>;
}
```

**Resulting HTML**

```html
<div>Component: <b>Hello world</b></p>
```

## Properties

React components also allow you to pass information to them in the form of element properties. The component receives the properties in its constructor and then can display them when it renders.

**JSX**

```jsx
<div>Component: <Demo who="Walke" /><div>
```

**React component**

```jsx
function Demo(props) {
  return <b>Hello {props.who}</b>;
}
```

**Resulting HTML**

```html
<div>Component: <b>Hello Walke</b></div>
```

## State

In addition to properties, a component can have internal state. Component state is created by calling the `React.useState` hook function. The useState function returns a variable that contains the current state and a function to update the state. The following example creates a state variable called `clicked` and toggles the click state in the `updateClicked` function that gets called when the paragraph text is clicked.

```jsx
const Clicker = () => {
  const [clicked, updateClicked] = React.useState(false);

  const onClicked = (e) => {
    updateClicked(!clicked);
  };

  return <p onClick={(e) => onClicked(e)}>clicked: {`${clicked}`}</p>;
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Clicker />);
```

You should note that you can use JSX even without a function. A simple variable representing JSX will work anyplace you would otherwise provide a component.

```jsx
const hello = <div>Hello</div>;

ReactDOM.render(hello, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Class style components

In addition to the preferred `function style` components demonstrated above, React also supports `class style` components. However, you should note that the React team is moving away from the class style representation, and for that reason you should probably not use it. With that said, you are likely to see class style components and so you should be aware of the syntax. Below is the equivalent class style component for the Clicker component that we created above.

The major difference is that properties are loaded on the constructor and state is set using a `setState` function on the component object.

```jsx
class Clicker extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      clicked: false,
    };
  }
  onClicked() {
    this.setState({
      clicked: !this.state.clicked,
    });
  }
  render() {
    return <p onClick={(e) => this.onClicked(e)}>clicked: {`${this.state.clicked}`}</p>;
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Clicker />);
```

## Reactivity

A component's properties and state are used by the React framework to determine the reactivity of the interface. Reactivity controls how a component reacts to actions taken by the user or events that happen within the application. Whenever a component's state or properties change, the render function for the component and all of its dependent component render functions are called.

### 🧧 Possible solution (spoilers!)

If you get stuck here is a possible solution.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      Function Style Component: <Demo who='function' color='yellow' />
    </div>
  );
}

const Demo = ({ who, initialColor }) => {
  const [color, setColor] = React.useState(initialColor);
  const [outlook, setOutlook] = React.useState('beautiful');

  function changeOutlook() {
    setOutlook(outlook === 'exciting' ? 'beautiful' : 'exciting');
  }

  function changeColor() {
    var randomColor = Math.floor(Math.random() * 16777215).toString(16);
    setColor('#' + randomColor);
  }

  return (
    <div className='component' onMouseOver={changeColor} style={{ background: color }}>
      <p>
        Hello {outlook} {who}
      </p>
      <button onClick={changeOutlook}>change</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

# Reactivity

Making the UI react to changes in user input or data, is one of the architectural foundations of React. React enables reactivity with three major pieces of a React component: `props`, `state`, and `render`.

When a component's JSX is rendered, React parses the JSX and creates a list of any references to the component's `state` or `prop` objects. React then monitors those objects and if it detects that they have changed it will call the component's `render` function so that the impact of the change is visualized.

The following example contains two components. A parent Survey component and a child Question component. The Survey has a state named `color`. The Question has a property named `color`. The Survey passes its `color` state to the Question as a property. This means that any change to the Survey's color will also be reflected in the Question's color. This is a powerful means for a parent to control a child's functionality.

The Question component also has a state named `answer`. The value of answer is displayed as part of the Question's content. The user can interact with this state through HTML radio input elements. When one of the inputs is changed the Question's `onChange` function is called and the answer state is updated to reflect the user's choice. This automatically causes the display of the answer to be updated.

Be careful about your assumptions of when state is updated. Just because you called `updateState` does not mean that you can access the updated state on the next line of code. The update happens asynchronously, and therefore you never really know when it is going to happen, you only know that it will eventually happen.

```jsx
// The Survey component
const Survey = () => {
  const [color, updateColor] = React.useState('#737AB0');

  // When the color changes update the state
  const onChange = (e) => {
    updateColor(e.target.value);
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Survey</h1>
      {/* Pass the Survey color state as a property to the Question.
          When to color changes the Question property will also be updated and rendered. */}
      <Question color={color} />

      <p>
        <span>Pick a color: </span>
        {/* Pass the Survey color state as a property to the input element.
            When to color changes, the input property will also be updated and rendered. */}
        <input type='color' onChange={(e) => onChange(e)} value={color} />
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

// The Question component
const Question = ({ color }) => {
  const [answer, updateAnswer] = React.useState('pending...');

  function onChange({ target }) {
    updateAnswer(target.value);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <span>Do you like this</span>
      {/* Color rerendered whenever the property changes */}
      <span style={{ color: color }}> color</span>?
      <label>
        <input type='radio' name='answer' value='yes' onChange={(e) => onChange(e)} />
        Yes
      </label>
      <label>
        <input type='radio' name='answer' value='no' onChange={(e) => onChange(e)} />
        No
      </label>
      {/* Answer rerendered whenever the state changes */}
      <p>Your answer: {answer}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<Survey />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### 🧧 Possible solution (spoilers!)

If you get stuck here is a possible solution.

```jsx
// The Survey component
const Survey = () => {
  const [text, updateText] = React.useState('');

  const onChange = (e) => {
    updateText(e.target.value);
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Survey</h1>
      <Question text={text} />

      <p>
        <span>Type some text: </span>
        <input type='text' onChange={(e) => onChange(e)} placeholder='type here' />
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

// The Question component
const Question = ({ text }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You typed: {text}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

# React hooks

React hooks allow React function style components to be able to do everything that a class style component can do and more. Additionally, as new features are added to React they are including them as hooks. This makes function style components the preferred way of doing things in React. You have already see one use of hooks to declare and update state in a function component with the `useState` hook.

```jsx
function Clicker({ initialCount }) {
  const [count, updateCount] = React.useState(initialCount);
  return <div onClick={() => updateCount(count + 1)}>Click count: {count}</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<Clicker initialCount={3} />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## useEffect hook

The `useEffect` hook allows you to represent lifecycle events. For example, if you want to run a function every time the component completes rendering, you could do the following.

```jsx
function UseEffectHookDemo() {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log('rendered');
  });

  return <div>useEffectExample</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<UseEffectHookDemo />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

You can also take action when the component cleans up by returning a cleanup function from the function registered with `useEffect`. In the following example, every time the component is clicked the state changes and so the component is rerendered. This causes both the cleanup function to be called in addition to the hook function. If the function was not rerendered then only the cleanup function would be called.

```jsx
function UseEffectHookDemo() {
  const [count, updateCount] = React.useState(0);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log('rendered');

    return function cleanup() {
      console.log('cleanup');
    };
  });

  return <div onClick={() => updateCount(count + 1)}>useEffectExample {count}</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<UseEffectHookDemo />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

This is useful when you want to create side effects for things such as tracking when a component is displayed or hidden, or creating and disposing of resources.

## Hook dependencies

You can control what triggers a `useEffect` hook by specifying its dependencies. In the following example we have two state variables, but we only want the `useEffect` hook to be called when the component is initially called and when the first variable is clicked. To accomplish this you pass an array of dependencies as a second parameter to the `useEffect` call.

```jsx
function UseEffectHookDemo() {
  const [count1, updateCount1] = React.useState(0);
  const [count2, updateCount2] = React.useState(0);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log(`count1 effect triggered ${count1}`);
  }, [count1]);

  return (
    <ol>
      <li onClick={() => updateCount1(count1 + 1)}>Item 1 - {count1}</li>
      <li onClick={() => updateCount2(count2 + 1)}>Item 2 - {count2}</li>
    </ol>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<UseEffectHookDemo />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

If you specify and empty array `[]` as the hook dependency then it is only called when the component is first rendered.

Note that hooks can only be used in function style components and must be called at the top scope of the function. That means a hook cannot be called inside of a loop or conditional. This restriction ensures that hooks are always called in the same order when a component is rendered.

# Toolchains

As web programming becomes more and more complex it became necessary to abstract away some of that complexity with a series of tools. Some common functional pieces in a web application chain include:

- **Code repository** - Stores code in a shared, versioned, location.
- **Linter** - Removes, or warns, of non-idiomatic code usage.
- **Prettier** - Formats code according to a shared standard.
- **Transpiler** - Compiles code into a different format. For example, from JSX to JavaScript.
- **Polyfill** - Generates backward compatible code for supporting old browser versions that do not support the latest standards.
- **Bundler** - Packages code into bundles for delivery to the browser. This enables compatibility (for example with ES6 module support), or performance (with lazy loading).
- **Minifier** - Removes whitespace and renames variables in order to make code smaller and more efficient to deploy.
- **Testing** - Automated tests at multiple levels to ensure correctness.
- **Deployment** - Automated packaging and delivery of code from the development environment to the production environment.

The toolchain that we use for our React project consists of [GitHub](https://github.com/) as the code repository, [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/) for transpiling, [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/) for polyfill, bundling, and minifying, and finally a simple bash script (deployReact.sh) for deployment.

You don't have to fully understand what each of these pieces in the chain are accomplishing, but the more you know about them the more you can optimize your development efforts.

# React CLI

Now that we have covered the basics of React, we want to extend our usage to include a full web framework toolchain that allows us to use JSX, minification, polyfills, and bundling for our Simon and startup applications. One common way for configuring your project to take advantage of these technologies is to use a Command Line Interface (CLI) to initially set up a React based project.

A CLI is a program that runs from the console and usually provides an assortment of commands related to some specific purpose. For example, the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) allows you to interact with all of its services. This saves you the time of having to bring up the AWS website interface when you want to use an AWS service. Instead of opening a browser, logging in, navigating to a service, and walking through a bunch of UI dialogs, you simply open your console window and use the AWS CLI to execute a single command.

To set up our React toolchain we will use the `create-react-app` CLI. This CLI will create and configure a template React application that you can use as a starting place for your application. `create-react-app` is an NPM package that works as a console program. Previously you used npm packages to add code libraries to your applications, but you can also run NPM packages as if they were a console program, if they are [configured](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/118810260230/building-a-simple-command-line-tool-with-npm.html) to do so.

The common way to run CLI NPM programs is to use the `NPX` program that was included when you installed NPM. NPX will temporarily download the desired package from NPM and then execute it using Node. Basically, NPX is just a short cut for `NPM install` and `NPM start`. It also has the advantage of not actually persistently installing the package and so it doesn't leave any clutter behind in your development environment.

When you run `create-react-app` with NPX, it creates a brand new React application project based on a standard template. You can see how this works by running the following from your console window. Make sure you are in a directory where you keep your coding projects. For example, `cd ~/src/byu/cs260`.

```sh
npx create-react-app test-react
```

When this runs it will create a project directory named `test-react`, create a bunch of project template files, and install the NPM packages necessary to use React and the associated toolchain. You can examine the project it created by changing into the `test-react` directory and opening VS Code.

```sh
cd test-react
code .
```

Before we look at what the generated project contains, let's run the application and see what it does. From the `test-react` directory run `npm start`.

```sh
➜  npm start

Compiled successfully!

You can now view test-react in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
```

This should automatically launch the application and open your browser to display the application running on port 3000.

![React CLI Application](reactCliApp.png)

To stop the application, use the `CTRL-C` (kill) keystroke in the console window where you started it.

Congratulations you have just used a CLI to create a React based web application. Time for cookies.

## Generated project

Let's examine the file and directory structure that `create-react-app` created.

| Directory | File               | Purpose                                                      |
| --------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ./        | .gitignore         | Specifies files to not include in your Git commits           |
|           | package-json       | NPM definition for included packages and script commands     |
|           | package-lock.json  | Version constraints for included packages (do not edit this) |
|           | README.md          | GitHub readme for the project                                |
| ./public  | index.html         | Primary page for the application                             |
|           | favicon.ico        | Primary application icon                                     |
|           | logo\*.png         | Icons used for mobile devices                                |
|           | manifest.json      | Configuration for use on mobile devices (PWA support)        |
|           | robots.txt         | Directives for search engine crawlers like Google            |
| ./src     | index.js           | Entry point for code execution                               |
|           | index.css          | CSS for top level component                                  |
|           | App.css            | CSS for the main application component                       |
|           | App.js             | JavaScript for the main application component                |
|           | App.test.js        | Automated tests for the main application component           |
|           | logo.svg           | Image displayed in the main application component            |
|           | reportWebVitals.js | Configuration for reporting application performance          |
|           | setupTests.js      | Set up for automated tests                                   |

At a high level `create-react-app` did the following:

1. Updated `./package-json` to include the necessary NPM packages for running and testing a React application.
1. Created `./public/index.html` as the entry point for the browser to load your application
1. Created `./src/index.js` to initialize the React application
1. Created `./src/app.js` to provide the top level React component

All the other files provide styling, use on mobile devices, testing, and performance monitoring.

## Digging into the generated code

When the browser requests to load your application it gets `index.html` by default. `index.html` contains the basic metadata for the application, but the actual content is injected into the HTML, at runtime, based upon the code contained in `index.js`. This happens because React by default will look for a file named `index.js` and execute it. The `index.js` file contains code that looks for a `div` element named `root` and renders the App component into that div. This causes the `App` component to be loaded from `App.js` which finally provides the content that you see visualized in the browser.

![React flow](reactCliFlow.png)

From this basic template code, you can build your application by replacing the App component, adding new React child components to the App component, and introducing a React router.

## What the toolchain is doing

When you run `npm start` it executes the `start` script found in `package.json`.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
  }
```

This runs another NPM CLI package called `react-scripts` and tells it to build the application from the code and launch it with a development HTTP server similar to the Live Server extension you have been using in VS Code. `react-scripts` then launches your browser and points it to `localhost:3000` where you can see the application rendering. Note that the development HTTP server will monitor changes to the application source and automatically rebuild it. Try this out by starting the application, editing the `App.js` file to contain something different, saving it, and looking at the browser window displaying the application.

![React CLI reload](reactCliReload.gif)

When `react-scripts` builds the application it converts the React JSX files to valid JavaScript and populates the `index.html` file with references to the generated files. If you look at `index.html` in your project, you will see that it contains a fairly bare bones HTML page.

**Template version of index.html**

```html
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />
    <meta name="description" content="Web site created using create-react-app" />
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/logo192.png" />
    <link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" />
    <title>React App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

If you start the application, and use the browser's debugger to look at the actual HTML loaded into the DOM you will see the result of the toolchain manipulation and bundling. (Note that this code has been abbreviated for clarity of the example.) Our `index.html` file now has injected file paths, JavaScript for running the React web framework in the browser, CSS elements for the currently rendered components, and the transpiled component HTML from the React components.

**DOM version of index.html**

```html

## Modifying the generated project

There is nothing that `create-react-app` does that you should consider off limits for change or improvement. If you take the time to understand what it is doing and why, then you should feel free to customize the application to how you would like it to work. At a basic level you should always do the following:

1. Replace the icon files with your own icons
1. Modify the manifest.json and package.json to contain your application name
1. Modify the README.md to describe your application
1. Modify index.html to contain a proper title and description metadata.

### Removing testing and performance monitoring

As an example of more extension modifications, we can remove the testing and performance packages that `create-react-app` included in the template. You might do this because you are trying to simplify the project for demonstration purposes, or because you want to replace it with a different testing framework such as Playwright.

To make this change, we first use NPM to **uninstall** the `@testing-library` packages. This removes the packages from `package.json` so that they are no longer installed in `node_modules` when you run `npm install`.

```sh
npm uninstall @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event
```

Next delete the test JavaScript files `setupTest.js` and `App.test.js`. With the testing packages gone, nothing will call this code and so we can simply delete it.

```sh
rm src/setupTests.js src/App.test.js
```

We can also remove the performance reporting package and code in order to simplify our application even further.

```sh
npm uninstall web-vitals
rm src/reportWebVitals.js
```

Finally, we remove the references to `reportWebVitals` from `index.js` since that package is no longer available.

**index.js**

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
// -> Delete
// import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

// -> Delete
// reportWebVitals();
```

If we run `npm start` again the application will run the same as before, but without testing or performance monitoring support. You can now insert a different package for these vital functions if you so desire.

If you want to strip the project down even more, you can also delete the robots.txt, manifest.json, and the logo\*.png files.

Temporarily deleting code is sometimes a good strategy to use when trying to learn how the code works. If everything is committed to Git then you can easily do experiments like this.

### JSX vs JS

The `create-react-app` CLI uses the `.js` (JavaScript) extension for JSX files instead of `.jsx`. The Babel transpiler will work with either one, but some editor tools will work differently based upon the extension. For this reason, you might consider renaming the `.js` files that actually contain JSX to use `.jsx` instead. The developers at AirBNB had an interesting [conversation](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/985) on this topic that you might browse if you would like to consider the differing opinions on this subject.

## Building a production release

Now that you have your React application the way that you like you need to build a production ready release. You do this by running `npm run build`. The executes the `build` script found in your `package.json`. The `build` script transpiles, minifies, and injects the proper JavaScript, and then outputs everything to a deployment ready version contained in a subdirectory named `build`.

```sh
➜  npm run build

Creating an optimized production build...
Compiled successfully.
```

The deployment scripts for Simon React creates a distribution package by calling `npm run build` and then copying the `build` directory out to your production server.

## Other React project generators

The `create-react-app` CLI is not the only tool that you can use to generate a templated React project. For example, there is also `nano-react-app`, that uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) instead of [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), and results in a very minimal collection of template files. If you are comfortable with what `create-react-app` is doing, then you might experiment with some of the other CLI alternatives. Otherwise, just stick with `create-react-app` for now.

# Router

A web framework router provides essential functionality for single page applications. With a multiple web page application the headers, footers, navigation, and common components must be either duplicated in each HTML page, or injected before the server sends the page to the browser. With a single page application the browser only loads one HTML page and then JavaScript is used to manipulate the DOM and give it the appearance of multiple pages. The router defines the routes a user can take through the application, and automatically manipulates the DOM to display the appropriate framework components.

React does not have a standard router package, and there are many that you can choose from. We will use [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) Version 6. The simplified routing functionality of React-router-dom derives from the project [react-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router) for its core functionality. Do not confuse the two, or versions of react-router-dom before version 6, when reading tutorials and documentation.

A basic implementation of the router consists of a `BrowserRouter` component that encapsulates the entire application and controls the routing action. The `Link` component captures user navigation events and modifies what is rendered by the `Routes` component by matching up the `to` and `path` attributes.

```jsx
// Inject the router into the application root DOM element
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  // BrowserRouter component that controls what is rendered
  // NavLink component captures user navigation requests
  // Routes component defines what component is routed to
  <BrowserRouter>
    <div className='app'>
      <nav>
        <NavLink to='/'>Home</Link>
        <NavLink to='/about'>About</Link>
        <NavLink to='/users'>Users</Link>
      </nav>

      <main>
        <Routes>
          <Route path='/' element={<Home />} exact />
          <Route path='/about' element={<About />} />
          <Route path='/users' element={<Users />} />
          <Route path='*' element={<Navigate to='/' replace />} />
        </Routes>
      </main>
    </div>
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```
