When planning gifts, it can be really tricky to get something the person wants without letting them know. It can also be hard to ensure they don’t get any duplicate gifts. Wishlist Wizard helps manage all of this easily. Users can view the wish list of a friend or search the list and notify other users once they pick out a gift in just a few taps. The recipient will never get another duplicate gift again, all the while not ruining the surprise.
Key features:
-	Secure login over https
-	Display a searchable wish-list
-	Notify gift givers when a gift is selected
-	Gift recipients don’t know what they’re going to get

Here's a link to that [repo](https://github.com/haltosan/simon) and my [website](https://simon.notawebdev.click/)

Using windows is kinda tricky. The deploy scripts are bash, so it's big sad. Also, the pem they gave us doesn't like to work on windows because of odd permission errors. I still can't get it to work unless I'm using a custom ssh client. Oh well. I can do sftp from there to deploy everything manually, but it isn't the worst. I need a better dev environ right now. All I'm using is notepad++ and command prompt for git. VSCode may be the only way at this point.
