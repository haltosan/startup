When planning gifts, it can be really tricky to get something the person wants without letting them know. It can also be hard to ensure they don’t get any duplicate gifts. Wishlist Wizard helps manage all of this easily. Users can view the wish list of a friend or search the list and notify other users once they pick out a gift in just a few taps. The recipient will never get another duplicate gift again, all the while not ruining the surprise.
Key features:
-	Secure login over https
-	Display a searchable wish-list
-	Notify gift givers when a gift is selected
-	Gift recipients don’t know what they’re going to get

Here's a link to that [repo](https://github.com/haltosan/simon) and my [website](https://simon.notawebdev.click/)

Using windows is kinda tricky. The deploy scripts are bash, so it's big sad. Also, the pem they gave us doesn't like to work on windows because of odd permission errors. I still can't get it to work unless I'm using a custom ssh client. Oh well. I can do sftp from there to deploy everything manually, but it isn't the worst. I need a better dev environ right now. All I'm using is notepad++ and command prompt for git. VSCode may be the only way at this point.

Styling can be pretty hard. I was having trouble getting anything to show up properly. Turns out I was missing the main.css file completely and the only styling it could apply was from bootstrap. Bootstrap is also really nice and gives you a lot of nice features. It does take a while to learn what is available, and I expect I'll be learning for a while.

Javascript can be tricky. I had issues with local storage. When I was hosting the server off my local file system (just opening the html files in my browser), local storage wasn't being kept between each page. In deployment, it was remembering between pages. In the end, I figured out that the file system version didn't work as a continuous website (the browser has no way of knowing), but the deployed version was all under the same domain name.
