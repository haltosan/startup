# Web services introduction

Up to this point, your entire application is loaded from your web server and ran on the user's browser. It starts when the browser requests the `index.html` file from the web server. The `index.html`, in turn references other HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or image files. All of these files, that are running on the browser, comprise the `frontend` of your application.

Notice that when the frontend requests the application files from the web server it is using the HTTPS protocol. All web programming requests between devices use HTTPS to exchange data.

From our frontend Javascript we can make requests to external services running anywhere in the world. This allows us to get external data, such as an inspirational quote, that we then inject into the DOM for the user to read. To make a web service request, we supply the URL of the web service to the `fetch` function that is built into the browser.

![Frontend Fetch](frontEndFetch.png)

The next step in building a full stack web application, is to create our own web service. Our web service will provide the static frontend files along with functions to handle `fetch` requests for things like storing data persistently, providing security, running tasks, executing application logic that you don't want your user to be able to see, and communicating with other users. The functionality provided by your web service represents the `backend` of your application.

Generally the functions provided by a web service are called `endpoints`, or sometimes APIs. You access the web service endpoints from your frontend JavaScript with the fetch function. In the picture below, the backend web service is not only providing the static files that make up the frontend, but also providing the web service endpoints that the frontend calls to do things like get a user, create a user, or get high scores.

![Backend](backEnd.png)

The backend web service can also use `fetch` to make requests to other web services. For example, in the image below the frontend uses fetch to request the user's data from the backend web service. The backend then uses fetch to call two other web services, one to get the user's data from the database, and another one to request subway routes that are near the user's home. That data is then combined together by the backend web service and returned to the frontend for display in the browser.

In following instruction we will discuss, how to use fetch, HTTP, URLs, and build a web service using the Node.js application. With all of this in place your application will be a full stack application comprised of both a frontend and a backend.

# URL

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN What is a URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL)

The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) represents the location of a web resource. A web resource can be anything, such as a web page, font, image, video stream, database record, or JSON object. It can also be completely ephemeral, such as a visitation counter, or gaming session.

Looking at the different parts of a URL is a good way to understand what it represents. Here is an example URL that represents the summary of accepted CS 260 BYU students that is accessible using secure HTTP.

```js
https://byu.edu:443/cs/260/student?filter=accepted#summary
```

The URL syntax uses the following convention. Notice the delimiting punctuation between the parts of the URL. Most parts of the URL are optional. The only ones that are required are the scheme, and the domain name.

```yaml
<scheme>://<domain name>:<port>/<path>?<parameters>#<anchor>
```

| Part        | Example                              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scheme      | https                                | The protocol required to ask for the resource. For web applications, this is usually HTTPS. But it could be any internet protocol such as FTP or MAILTO.                                                                                                                            |
| Domain name | byu.edu                              | The domain name that owns the resource represented by the URL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Port        | 3000                                 | The port specifies the numbered network port used to connect to the domain server. Lower number ports are reserved for common internet protocols, higher number ports can be used for any purpose. The default port is 80 if the scheme is HTTP, or 443 if the scheme is HTTPS.     |
| Path        | /school/byu/user/8014                | The path to the resource on the domain. The resource does not have to physically be located on the file system with this path. It can be a logical path representing endpoint parameters, a database table, or an object schema.                                                    |
| Parameters  | filter=names&highlight=intro,summary | The parameters represent a list of key value pairs. Usually it provides additional qualifiers on the resource represented by the path. This might be a filter on the returned resource or how to highlight the resource. The parameters are also sometimes called the query string. |
| Anchor      | summary                              | The anchor usually represents an sub-location in the resource. For HTML pages this represents a request for the browser to automatically scroll to the element with an ID that matches the anchor. The anchor is also sometimes called the hash, or fragment ID.                    |

Technically you can also provide a user name and password before the domain name. This was used historically to authenticate access, but for security reasons this is deprecated. However, you will still see this convention for URLs that represent database connection strings.

## URL, URN, and URI

You will sometimes hear the use of URN or URI when talking about web resources. A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a unique resource name that does not specify location information. For example, a book URN might be `urn:isbn:10,0765350386`. A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a general resource identifier that could refer to either a URL and URN. With web programming you are almost always talking about URLs and therefore you should not use the more general URI.

# Ports

When you connect to a device on the internet you need both an IP address and a numbered port. Port numbers allow a single device to support multiple protocols (e.g. HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, or SSH) as well as different types of services (e.g. search, document, or authentication). The ports may be exposed externally, or they may only be used internally on the device. For example, the HTTPS port (443) might allow the world to connect, the SSH port (22) might only allow computers at your school, and a service defined port (say 3000) may only allow access to processes running on the device.

The internet governing body, IANA, defines the standard usage for port numbers. Ports from 0 to 1023 represent standard protocols. Generally a web service should avoid these ports unless it is providing the protocol represented by the standard. Ports from 1024 to 49151 represent ports that have been assigned to requesting entities. However, it is very common for these ports to be used by services running internally on a device. Ports from 49152 to 65535 are considered dynamic and are used to create dynamic connections to a device. [Here](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml) is the link to IANA's registry.

Here is a list of common port numbers that you might come across.

| Port | Protocol                                                                                           |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 20   | File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for data transfer                                                     |
| 22   | Secure Shell (SSH) for connecting to remote devices                                                |
| 25   | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for sending email                                             |
| 53   | Domain Name System (DNS) for looking up IP addresses                                               |
| 80   | Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for web requests                                                |
| 110  | Post Office Protocol (POP3) for retrieving email                                                   |
| 123  | Network Time Protocol (NTP) for managing time                                                      |
| 161  | Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for managing network devices such as routers or printers |
| 194  | Internet Relay Chat (IRC) for chatting                                                             |
| 443  | HTTP Secure (HTTPS) for secure web requests                                                        |

## Your ports

As an example of how ports are used we can look at your web server. When you built your web server you externally exposed port 22 so that you could use SSH to open a remote console on the server, port 443 for secure HTTP communication, and port 80 for unsecure HTTP communication.

![Ports](webServicesPorts.jpg)

Your web service, Caddy, is listening on ports 80 and 443. When Caddy gets a request on port 80, it automatically redirects the request to port 443 so that a secure connection is used. When Caddy gets a request on port 443 it examines the path provided in the HTTP request (as defined by the URL) and if the path matches a static file, it reads the file off disk and returns it. If the HTTP path matches one of the definitions it has for a gateway service, Caddy makes a connection on that service's port (e.g. 3000 or 4000) and passes the request to the service.

Internally on your web server, you can have as many web services running as you would like. However, you must make sure that each one uses a different port to communicate on. You run your Simon service on port 3000 and therefore **cannot** use port 3000 for your startup service. Instead you use port 4000 for your startup service. It does not matter what high range port you use. It only matters that you are consistent and that they are only used by one service.

# HTTP

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN An overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)

HTTP is how the web talks. When a web browser makes a request to a web server it does it using the HTTP protocol. In previous instruction we discussed how to use HTTP. Now, we will talk about the internals of HTTP. Just like becoming fluent in a foreign language make a visit to another country more enjoyable, understanding how to speak HTTP helps you communicate effectively when talking on the web.

When a web client (e.g. a web browser) and a web server talk they exchange HTTP requests and responses. The browser will make an HTTP request and the server will generate an HTTP response. You can see the HTTP exchange by using the browser's debugger or by using a console tool like Curl. For example, in your console you can use curl to make the following request.

```sh
curl -v -s http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Helping.html
```

### Request

The HTTP request for the above command would look like the following.

```http
GET /hypertext/WWW/Helping.html HTTP/1.1
Host: info.cern.ch
Accept: text/html
```

An HTTP request has this general syntax.

```yaml
<verb> <url path, parameters, anchor> <version>
[<header key: value>]*
[

  <body>
]
```

The first line of the HTTP request contains the `verb` of the request, followed by the path, parameters, and anchor of the URL, and finally the version of HTTP being used. The following lines are optional headers that are defined by key value pairs. After the headers you have an optional body. The body start is delimited from the headers with two new lines.

In the above example, we are asking to `GET` a resource found at the path `/hypertext/WWW/Helping.html`. The version used by the request is `HTTP/1.1`. This is followed by two headers. The first specifies the requested host (i.e. domain name). The second specifies what type of resources the client will accept. The resource type is always a [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) as defined by internet governing body IANA. In this case we are asking for HTML.

### Response

The response to the above request looks like this.

```yaml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 06 Dec 2022 21:54:42 GMT
Server: Apache
Last-Modified: Thu, 29 Oct 1992 11:15:20 GMT
ETag: "5f0-28f29422b8200"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 1520
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<TITLE>Helping -- /WWW</TITLE>
<NEXTID 7>
<H1>How can I help?</H1>There are lots of ways you can help if you are interested in seeing
the <A NAME=4 HREF=TheProject.html>web</A> grow and be even more useful...
```

An HTTP response has the following syntax.

```yaml
<version> <status code> <status string>
[<header key: value>]*
[

  <body>
]
```

You can see that the response syntax is similar to the request syntax. The major difference is that the first line represents the version and the status of the response.

Understanding the meaning of the common HTTP verbs, status codes, and headers is important for you to understand, as you will use them in developing a web application. Take some time to internalize the following common values.

## Verbs

There are several verbs that describe what the HTTP request is asking for. The list below only describes the most common ones.

| Verb    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET     | Get the requested resource. This can represent a request to get a single resource or a resource representing a list of resources.                                                                                                                        |
| POST    | Create a new resource. The body of the request contains the resource. The response should include a unique ID of the newly created resource.                                                                                                             |
| PUT     | Update a resource. Either the URL path, HTTP header, or body must contain the unique ID of the resource being updated. The body of the request should contain the updated resource. The body of the response may contain the resulting updated resource. |
| DELETE  | Delete a resource. Either the URL path or HTTP header must contain the unique ID of the resource to delete.                                                                                                                                              |
| OPTIONS | Get metadata about a resource. Usually only HTTP headers are returned. The resource itself is not returned.                                                                                                                                              |

## Status codes

It is important that you use the standard HTTP status codes in your HTTP responses so that the client of a request can know how to interpret the response. The codes are partitioned into five blocks.

- 1xx - Informational.
- 2xx - Success.
- 3xx - Redirect to some other location, or that the previously cached resource is still valid.
- 4xx - Client errors. The request is invalid.
- 5xx - Server errors. The request cannot be satisfied due to an error on the server.

Within those ranges here are some of the more common codes. See the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) for a full description of status codes.

| Code | Text                                                                                 | Meaning                                                                                                                           |

## Headers

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)

HTTP headers specify metadata about a request or response. This includes things like how to handle security, caching, data formats, and cookies. Some common headers that you will use include the following.

| Header                      | Example                              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Body

The format of the body of an HTTP request or response is defined by the `Content-Type` header. For example, it may be HTML text (text/html), a binary image format (image/png), JSON (application/json), or JavaScript (text/javascript). A client may specify what formats it accepts using the `accept` header.

## Cookies

![Cookie](webServicesCookie.png)

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Using HTTP cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)

HTTP itself is stateless. This means that one HTTP request does not know anything about a previous or future request. However, that does not mean that a server or client cannot track state across requests. One common method for tracking state is the `cookie`. Cookies are generated by a server and passed to the client as an HTTP header.

```http
HTTP/2 200
Set-Cookie: myAppCookie=tasty; SameSite=Strict; Secure; HttpOnly
```

The client then caches the cookie and returns it as an HTTP header back to the server on subsequent requests.

```http
HTTP/2 200
Cookie: myAppCookie=tasty
```

This allows the server to remember things like the language preference of the user, or the user's authentication credentials. A server can also use cookies to track, and share, everything that a user does. However, there is nothing inherently evil about cookies, the problem comes from web applications that use them as a means to violate a user's privacy or inappropriately monetize their data.

## HTTP Versions

HTTP continually evolves in order to increase performance and support new types of applications. You can read about the evolution of HTTP on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Evolution_of_HTTP).

| Year | Version | Features                                        |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1990 | HTTP0.9 | one line, no versions, only get                 |
| 1996 | HTTP1   | get/post, header, status codes, content-type    |
| 1997 | HTTP1.1 | put/patch/delete/options, persistent connection |
| 2015 | HTTP2   | multiplex, server push, binary representation   |
| 2022 | HTTP3   | QUIC for transport protocol, always encrypted   |

# SOP and CORS

📖 **Deeper dive reading**:

- [MDN Same origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy)
- [MDN Cross origin resource sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)

Security should always be on your mind when you are working with the web. The ability to provide services to a global audience makes the information on the web very valuable, and therefore an attractive target for nefarious parties. When website architecture and browser clients were still in their infancy they allowed JavaScript to make requests from one domain while displaying a website from a different domain. These are called cross-origin requests.

Consider the following example. An attacker sends out an email with a link to a hacker website (`byu.iinstructure.com`) that is similar to the real course website. Notice the additional `i`. If the hacker website could request anything from the real website then it could make itself appear and act just like the real education website. All it would have to do is request images, html, and login endpoints from the course's website and display the results on the hacker website. This would give the hacker access to everything the user did.

To combat this problem the `Same Origin Policy` (SOP) was created. Simply stated SOP only allows JavaScript to make requests to a domain if it is the same domain that the user is currently viewing. A request from `byu.iinstructure.com` for service endpoints that are made to `byu.instructure.com` would fail because the domains do not match. This provides significant security, but it also introduces complications when building web applications. For example, if you want build a service that any web application can use it would also violate the SOP and fail. In order to address this, the concept of Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) was invented.

CORS allows the client (e.g. browser) to specify the origin of a request and then let the server respond with what origins are allowed. The server may say that all origins are allowed, for example if they are a general purpose image provider, or only a specific origin is allowed, for example if they are a bank's authentication service. If the server doesn't specify what origin is allowed then the browser assumes that it must be the same origin.

Going back to our hacker example, the HTTP request from the hacker site (`byu.iinstructure.com`) to the course's authentication service (`byu.instructure.com`) would look like the following.

```http
GET /api/auth/login HTTP/2
Host: byu.instructure.com
Origin: https://byu.iinstructure.com
```

In response the banking website would return:

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://byu.instructure.com
```

The browser would then see that the actual origin of the request does not match the allowed origin and so the browser blocks the response and generates an error.

Notice that with CORS, it is the browser that is protecting the user from accessing the banking website's authentication endpoint from the wrong origin. CORS is only meant to alert the user that something nefarious is being attempted. A hacker can still proxy requests through their own server to the banking website and completely ignore the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. Therefore the banking website needs to implement its own precautions to stop a hacker for using its services inappropriately.

## Using third party services

When you make requests to your own web services you are always on the same origin and so you will not violate the SOP. However, if you want to make requests to a different domain than the one your web application is hosted on, then you need to make sure that domain allows requests as defined by the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header it returns. For example, if I have JavaScript in my web application loaded from `cs260.click` that makes a fetch request for an image from the website `i.picsum.photos` the browser will fail the request with an HTTP status code of 403 and an error message that CORS has blocked the request.

![CORS](webServicesCors.jpg)

That happens because `i.picsum.photos` does not return an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. Without a header the browser assumes that all requests must be made from the same origin.

If your web application instead makes a service request to `icanhazdadjoke.com` to get a joke, that request will succeed because `icanhazdadjoke.com` returns an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with a value of `*` meaning that any origin can make requests to this service.

```http
HTTP/2 200
access-control-allow-origin: *

Did you hear about the bread factory burning down? They say the business is toast.
```

This would have also succeeded if the HTTP header had explicitly listed your web application domain. For example, if you make your request from the origin `cs260.click` the following response would also satisfy CORS.

```http
HTTP/2 200
access-control-allow-origin: https://cs260.click

I’ll tell you something about German sausages, they’re the wurst
```

This all means that you need to test the services you want to use before you include them in your application. Make sure they are responding with `*` or your calling origin. If they do not then you will not be able to use them.

# Fetch

🔑 **Recommended reading**: [MDN Using the Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)

The ability to make HTTP requests from JavaScript is one of the main technologies that changed the web from static content pages (Web 1.0) to one of web applications (Web 2.0) that fully interact with the user. Microsoft introduced the first API for making HTTP requests from JavaScript with the [XMLHttpRequest API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).

Today, the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) is the preferred way to make HTTP requests. The `fetch` function is built into the browser's JavaScript runtime. This means you can call it from JavaScript code running in a browser.

The basic usage of fetch takes a URL and returns a promise. The promise `then` function takes a callback function that is asynchronously called when the requested URL content is obtained. If the returned content is of type `application/json` you can use the `json` function on the response object to convert it to a JavaScript object.

The following example makes a fetch request to get and display an inspirational quote.

```js
fetch('https://api.quotable.io/random')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((jsonResponse) => {
    console.log(jsonResponse);
  });
```

**Response**

```js
{
  content: 'Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.',
  author: 'Thomas Jefferson',
};
```

To do a POST request you populate the options parameter with the HTTP method and headers.

```js
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: 'test title',
    body: 'test body',
    userId: 1,
  }),
  headers: {
    'Content-type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8',
  },
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((jsonResponse) => {
    console.log(jsonResponse);
  });
```

# Service design

Web services provide the interactive functionality of your web application. They commonly authenticate users, track their session state, provide, store, and analyze data, connect peers, and aggregate user information. Making your web service easy to use, performant, and extensible are factors that determine the success of your application. A good design will result in increased productivity, satisfied users, and lower processing costs.

## Model and sequence diagrams

When first considering your service design it is helpful to model the application's primary objects and the interactions of the objects. You should attempt to stay as close to the model that is in your user's mind as possible. Avoid introducing a model that focuses on programming constructs and infrastructure. For example, a chat program should model participants, conversations, and messages. It should not model user devices, network connections, and data blobs.

Once you have defined your primary objects you can create sequence diagrams that show how the objects interact with each other. This will help clarify your model and define the necessary endpoints. You can use a simple tool like [SequenceDiagram.org](https://sequencediagram.org/index.html#initialData=C4S2BsFMAIGEAsCGxqIA5oFCcQY2APYBO0AguCLpDvsdAEIEBG25lkAtAHwDKkRAN34AuPikQDEIcIiZRMjJtz6CRY1JOmz5igDy6OHFUKLC2VDVJlzq5yPsPGRDZpa03Md5fxOjgiIhRcAgA7EwBnZBBQ6AB3MHgXFj0DIx8RWFCIqJiiSABHAFdIcJQQglAAM0ockIVmb1VTUlwqNBQ7aGCw-kjQUPqlXnTTHkQAT2gAIgAJSHBwAinoQjIKKkwnIm47YVn5xeXKogIAWySgA) to create and share diagrams.

![Sequence Diagram](webServicesSequenceDiagram.jpg)

## Leveraging HTTP

Web services are usually provided over HTTP, and so HTTP greatly influences the design of the service. The HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE often mirror the designed actions of a web service. For example, a web service for managing comments might list the comments (GET), create a comment (POST), update a comment (PUT), and delete a comment (DELETE). Likewise, the MIME content types defined by IANA are a natural fit for defining the types of content that you want to provide (e.g. HTML, PNG, MP3, and MP4). The goal is to leverage those technologies as much as possible so that you don't have to recreate the functionality they provide and instead take advantage of the significant networking infrastructure built up around HTTP. This includes caching servers that increase your performance, edge servers that bring your content closer, and replication servers that provide redundant copies of your content and make your application more resilient to network failures.

<img src='webServicesHTTPServices.jpg' width=400 />

## Endpoints

A web service is usually divided up into multiple service endpoints. Each endpoint provides a single functional purpose. All of the criteria that you would apply to creating well designed code functions also applies when exposing service endpoints.

<img src='webServicesHTTPEndpoints.jpg' width=400 />

⚠ Note that service endpoints are often called an Application Programming Interface (API). This is a throwback to old desktop applications and the programming interfaces that they exposed. Sometimes the term API refers to the entire collection of endpoints, and sometimes it is used to refer to a single endpoint.

Here are some things you should consider when designing your service's endpoints.

- **Grammatical** - With HTTP everything is a resource (think noun or object). You act on the resource with an HTTP verb. For example, you might have an order resource that is contained in a store resource. You then create, get, update, and delete order resources on the store resource.
- **Readable** - The resource you are referencing with an HTTP request should be clearly readable in the URL path. For example, an order resource might contain the path to both the order and store where the order resource resides: `/store/provo/order/28502`. This makes it easier to remember how to use the endpoint because it is human readable.
- **Discoverable** - As you expose resources that contain other resources you can provide the endpoints for the aggregated resources. This makes it so someone using your endpoints only needs to remember the top level endpoint and then they can discover everything else. For example, if you have a store endpoint that returns information about a store you can include an endpoint for working with a store in the response.

  ```http
  GET /store/provo  HTTP/2
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "id": "provo",
    "address": "Cougar blvd",
    "orders": "https://cs260.click/store/provo/orders",
    "employees": "https://cs260.click/store/provo/employees"
  }
  ```

- **Compatible** - When you build your endpoints you want to make it so that you can add new functionality without breaking existing clients. Usually this means that the clients of your service endpoints should ignore anything that they don't understand. Consider the two following JSON response versions.

  **Version 1**

  ```js
  {
    "name": "John Taylor"
  }
  ```

  **Version 2**

  ```js
  {
    "name": "John Taylor",
    "givenName": "John",
    "familyName": "Taylor"
  }
  ```

  By adding a new representation of the `name` field, you provide new functionality for clients that know how to use the new fields without harming older clients that ignore the new fields and simply use the old representation. This is all done without officially versioning the endpoint.

  If you are fortunate enough to be able to control all of your client code you can mark the `name` field as depreciated and in a future version remove it once all of the clients have upgraded. Usually you want to keep compatibility with at least one previous version of the endpoint so that there is enough time for all of the clients to migrate before compatibility is removed.

- **Simple** - Keeping your endpoints focused on the primary resources of your application helps to avoid the temptation to add endpoints that duplicate or create parallel access to primary resources. It is very helpful to write some simple class and sequence diagrams that outline your primary resources before you begin coding. These resources should focus on the actual resources of the system you are modeling. They should not focus on the data structure or devices used to host the resources. There should only be one way to act on a resource. Endpoints should only do one thing.

- **Documented** - The [Open API Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) is a good example of tooling that helps create, use, and maintain documentation of your service endpoints. It is highly suggested that you make use of such tools in order to provide client libraries for your endpoints and a sandbox for experimentation. Creating an initial draft of your endpoint documentation before you begin coding will help you mentally clarify your design and produce a better final result. Providing access to your endpoint documentation along with your production system helps with client implementations and facilitates easier maintenance of the service. The [Swagger Petstore](https://petstore.swagger.io/) example documentation is a reasonable example to follow.

There are many models for exposing endpoints. We will consider three common ones, RPC, REST, and GraphQL.

## RPC

Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) expose service endpoints as simple function calls. When RPC is used over HTTP it usually just leverages the POST HTTP verb. The actual verb and subject of the function call is represented by the function name. For example, `deleteOrder` or `updateOrder`. The name of the function is either the entire path of the URL or a parameter in the POST body.

```http
POST /updateOrder HTTP/2

{"id": 2197, "date": "20220505"}
```

or

```http
POST /rpc HTTP/2

{"cmd":"updateOrder", "params":{"id": 2197, "date": "20220505"}}
```

One advantage of RPC is that it maps directly to function calls that might exist within the server. This could also be considered a disadvantage as it directly exposes the inner workings of the service, and thus creates a coupling between the endpoints and the implementation.

## REST

Representational State Transfer (REST) attempts to take advantage of the foundational principles of HTTP. This is not surprising considering the principle author of REST, Roy Fielding, was also a contributor to the HTTP specification. REST HTTP verbs always act upon a resource. Operations on a resource impact the state of the resource as it is transferred by a REST endpoint call. This allows for the caching functionality of HTTP to work optimally. For example, GET will always return the same resource until a PUT is executed on the resource. When PUT is used, the cached resource is replaced with the updated resource.

With REST the updateOrder endpoint would look like the following.

```http
PUT /order/2197 HTTP/2

{"date": "20220505"}
```

Where the proper HTTP verb is used and the URL path uniquely identifies the resource. These seem like small differences, but maximizing HTTP pays dividends by making it easy for HTTP infrastructure, such as caching, to work properly.

There are several other pieces of [Fielding's dissertation](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm) on REST, such as hypermedia, that are often quoted as being required for a truly "restful" implementation, and these are just as often ignored.

## GraphQL

GraphQL focuses on the manipulation of data instead of a function call (RPC) or a resource (REST). The heart of GraphQL is a query that specifies the desired data and how it should be joined and filtered. GraphQL was developed to address frustration concerning the massive number of REST, or RPC calls, that a web application client needed to make in order to support even a simple UI widget.

Instead of making a call for getting a store, and then a bunch of calls for getting the store's orders and employees, GraphQL would send a single query that would request all of that information in one big JSON response. The server would examine the query, join the desired data, and then filter out anything that was not wanted.

Here is an example GraphQL query.

```graphql
query {
  getOrder(id: "2197") {
    orders(filter: { date: { allofterms: "20220505" } }) {
      store
      description
      orderedBy
    }
  }
}
```

GraphQL helps to remove a lot of the logic for parsing endpoints and mapping requests to specific resources. Basically in GraphQL there is only one endpoint. The query endpoint.

The downside of that flexibility is that the client now has significant power to consume resources on the server. There is no clear boundary on what, how much, or how complicated the aggregation of data is. It also is difficult for the server to implement authorization rights to data as they have to be baked into the data schema. However, there are standards for how to define a complex schema. Common GraphQL packages provide support for schema implementations along with database adaptors for query support.

# Node.js

<img src='NodeIcon.png' width='75px' />

In 2009 Ryan Dahl created `Node.js`. It was the first successful application for deploying JavaScript outside of a browser. This changed the JavaScript mindset from a browser technology to one that could run on the server as well. This means that JavaScript can power your entire technology stack. One language to rule them all. Node.js is often just referred to as Node, and is currently maintained by the [Open.js Foundation](https://openjsf.org/).

Browsers run JavaScript using a JavaScript interpreter and execution engine. For example, Chromium based browsers all use the [V8](https://v8.dev/) engine created by Google. Node.js simply took the V8 engine and ran it inside of a console application. When you run a JavaScript program in Chrome or Node.js, it is V8 that reads your code and executes it. With either program wrapping V8, the result is the same.

## Installing NVM and Node.js

Your production environment web server comes with Node.js already install. However, you will need to install Node.js in your development environment if you have not already. The easiest way to install Node.js is to first install the `Node Version Manager` (NVM) and use it to install, and manage, Node.js.

### Installing on Windows

If you are using Windows, then follow the installation instructions from the [windows-nvm](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installation--upgrades) repository. Click on `latest installer` and then scroll down to the `Assets` and download and execute nvm-setup.exe. Once the installation is complete, you will need to open a new console window so that it gets the updated path that includes NVM.

In the console application install the long term support (LTS) version of Node.

```sh
➜ nvm install lts
➜ nvm use lts
```

### Installing on Linux or MacOS

If you are using Linux or MacOS then you can install NVM with the following console commands.

```sh
➜ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash

➜ . ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
```

In the console application install the long term support (LTS) version of Node.

```sh
➜ nvm install --lts
```

## Checking that Node is installed

The node.js console application is simply called `node`. You can verify that Node is working correctly by running node with the `-v` parameter. Note that your version might be different than what is shown here. As long as it is a LTS version you should be fine.

```sh
➜ node -v
v18.13.0
```

## Running programs

You can execute a line of JavaScript with Node.js from your console with the `-e` parameter.

```sh
➜  node -e "console.log(1+1)"
2
```

However, to do real work you need to execute an entire project composed of dozens or even hundreds of JavaScript files. You do this by creating a single starting JavaScript file, named something like `main.js`, that references the code found in the rest your project. You then execute your code by running `node` with main.js as a parameter. For example, with the following JavaScript saved to a file named `main.js`

```js
function countdown() {
  let i = 0;
  while (i++ < 5) {
    console.log(`Counting ... ${i}`);
  }
}

countdown();
```

We can execute the JavaScript by passed the file to node, and receive the following result.

```sh
➜  node main.js
Counting ... 1
Counting ... 2
Counting ... 3
Counting ... 4
Counting ... 5
```

You can also run node in interpretive mode by executing it without any parameters and then typing your JavaScript code directly into the interpreter.

```sh
➜ node
Welcome to Node.js v16.15.1.
> 1+1
2
> console.log('hello')
hello
```

## Node package manager

While you could write all of the JavaScript for everything you need, it is always helpful to use preexisting packages of JavaScript for implementing common tasks. To load a package using Node.js you must take two steps. First install the package locally on your machine using the Node Package Manager (NPM), and then include a `require` statement in your code that references the package name. NPM is automatically installed when you installed Node.js.

NPM knows how to access a massive repository of preexisting packages. You can search for packages on the [NPM website](https://www.npmjs.com/). However, before you start using NPM to install packages you need to initialize you code to use NPM. This is done by creating a directory that will contain your JavaScript and then running `npm init`. NPM will step you through a series of questions about the project you are creating. You can press the return key for each of questions if you want to accept the defaults. If you are always going to accept all of the defaults you can use `npm init -y` and skip the Q&A.

```sh
➜  mkdir npmtest
➜  cd npmtest
➜  npm init -y
```

## Package.json

If you list the files in directory you will notice that it has created a file named `package.json`. This file contains three main things: 1) Metadata about your project such as its name and the default entry JavaScript file, 2) commands that you can execute to do things like run, test, or distribute your code, and 3) packages that this project depends upon. With NPM initialized to work with your project, you can now use it to install a node package. As a simple example, we will install a package that knows how to tell jokes. This package is called `give-me-a-joke`. You can search for it on the [NPM website](https://www.npmjs.com/), see how often it is installed, examine the source code, and learn about who created it. You install the package using `npm install` followed by the name of the package.

```sh
➜  npm install give-me-a-joke
```

If you again examine the contents of the `package.json` file you will see a reference to the newly installed package dependency. If you decide you no longer want a package dependency you can always remove it with the `npm uninstall <package name here>` console command.

⚠ Note that when you start installing package dependencies NPM will create an additional file named `package-lock.json` and a directory named `node-modules` in your project directory. The `node-modules` directory contains the actual JavaScript for the package and all of its dependent packages. As you install several packages this directory will start to get very large. You do **not** want to check this directory into your source control system since it is so large and can be rebuilt using the information contained in the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files. So make sure you include `node-modules` in your `.gitignore` file.

When you clone your source code from GitHub to a new location, just run `npm install` in the project directory. This will cause NPM to download all of the previously installed packages and recreate the `node-modules` directory. The `package-lock.json` file tracks the version of the package that you installed. That way if rebuild your `node-modules` directory you will have the version of the package you initially installed and not the latest available version, which might not be compatible with your code.

With NPM and the joke package installed, you can now use the package in a JavaScript file by referencing the package name as a parameter to the `require` function. This is then followed by a call the joke object's `getRandomDadJoke` function to actually generate a joke.

```js
const giveMeAJoke = require('give-me-a-joke');
giveMeAJoke.getRandomDadJoke((joke) => {
  console.log(joke);
});
```

If we run this code using node we get the following result.

```sh
➜  node main.js
What do you call a fish with no eyes? A fsh.
```

This may seem like a lot of work but after you do it a few times it will begin to feel natural. Just remember the main steps.

1. Create your project directory
1. Initialize it for use with NPM by running `npm init -y`
1. Make sure `.gitignore` file contains `node-modules`
1. Install any desired packages with `npm install <package name here>`
1. Add `require('<package name here>')` to your JavaScript code
1. Run your code with `node main.js`

## Creating a web service

With JavaScript we can write code that listens on a server port (e.g. 8080), receives HTTP requests, processes them, and then responds. We can use this to create a simple web service that we then execute using Node.js.

The following example first initializes the use of NPM and installs the package `http`. The http package contains the functionality for listening on server ports and manipulating HTTP requests.

```sh
➜ mkdir webservicetest
➜ cd webservicetest
➜ npm init -y
➜ npm install http
```

Now we can create our HTTP server using the `http.createServer` function and provide it with a callback function that takes a request (`req`) and response (`res`) object. That function is called whenever the server receives an HTTP request. In our example, the callback always returns the same HTML snippet, with a status code of 200, and a Content-Type header, no matter what request is made. Basically this is just a simple dynamically generated HTML page. A real web service would examine the HTTP path and return meaningful content based upon the purpose of the endpoint.

The `server.listen` call starts listening on port 8080 and blocks until the program is terminated.

```js
const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
  res.write('<h1>Hello Node.js!</h1>');
  res.end();
});

server.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log(`Web service listening on port 8080`);
});
```

We execute the program by passing our JavaScript to Node. If the service starts up correctly then it should look like the following.

```sh
➜ node main.js
Web service listening on port 8080
```

You can now open you browser and point it to `localhost:8080` and view the result. The interaction between the JavaScript, node, and the browser looks like this.

![Node HTTP](webServicesNodeHttp.jpg)

You can kill the process by pressing `CTRL-C` in the console.

## Deno and Bun

You should be aware that Ryan has created a successor to Node.js called [`Deno`](https://deno.land/). This version is more compliant with advances in ECMAScript and has significant performance enhancements. There are also competitor server JavaScript applications. One of the more interesting rising stars is called [`Bun`](https://bun.sh/). If you have the time you should learn about them.

# Express

<img src="expressIcon.png" width="75px" />

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Express/Node introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

In the previous instruction you saw how to use Node.js to create a simple web server. This works great for little projects where you are trying to quickly serve up some web content, but to build a production ready application you need a framework with a bit more functionality for easily implementing a full web service. This is where the Node package `Express` come in. Express provides support for:

1. Routing requests for service endpoints
1. Manipulating HTTP requests with JSON body content
1. Generating HTTP responses
1. Using `middleware` to add functionality

Express was created by TJ Holowaychuk and is currently maintained by the [Open.js Foundation](https://openjsf.org/).

![TJ Holowaychuk](webServicesHolowaychuk.jpg)

> “People tell you to not reinvent things, but I think you should … it will teach you things”
>
> — TJ Holowaychuk

Everything in Express revolves around creating and using HTTP routing and middleware functions.
You create an Express application by using NPM to install the Express package and then calling the `express` constructor to create the express application and listen for HTTP requests on a desired port.

```sh
➜ npm install express
```

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.listen(8080);
```

With the app object you can now add HTTP routing and middleware functions to the application.

## Defining routes

HTTP endpoints are implemented in Express by defining routes that call a function based upon an HTTP path. The Express app object supports all of the HTTP verbs as functions on the object. For example, if you want to have a route function that handles an HTTP GET request for the URL path `/store/provo` you would call the `get` method on the app.

```js
app.get('/store/provo', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({ name: 'provo' });
});
```

The `get` function takes two parameters, a URL path matching pattern, and a callback function that is invoked when the pattern matches. The path matching parameter is used to match against the URL path of an incoming HTTP request.

The callback function has three parameters that represent the HTTP request object (`req`), the HTTP response object (`res`), and the `next` routing function that Express expects to be called if this routing function wants another function to generate a response.

The express app compares the routing function patterns in the order that they are added to the Express app object. So if you have two routing functions with patterns that both match, the first one that was added will be called and given the next matching function in the `next` parameter.

In our example above we hard coded the store name to be `provo`. A real store endpoint would allow any store name to be provided as a parameter in the path. Express supports path parameters by prefixing the parameter name with a colon (`:`). Express creates a map of path parameters and populates it with the matching values found in the URL path. You then reference the parameters using the `req.params` object. Using this pattern you can rewrite our getStore endpoint as follows.

```js
app.get('/store/:storeName', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({ name: req.params.storeName });
});
```

If we run our JavaScript using node we can see the result when make an HTTP request using curl.

```sh
➜ curl localhost:8080/store/orem
{"name":"orem"}
```

If you wanted an endpoint that used the POST or DELETE HTTP verb then you just use the `post` or `delete` function on the Express app object.

The route path can also include a limited wildcard syntax or even full regular expressions in path pattern. Here are a couple route functions using different pattern syntax.

```js
// Wildcard - matches /store/x and /star/y
app.put('/st*/:storeName', (req, res) => res.send({ update: req.params.storeName }));

// Pure regular expression
app.delete(/\/store\/(.+)/, (req, res) => res.send({ delete: req.params[0] }));
```

Notice that in these examples the `next` parameter was omitted. Since we are not calling `next` we do not need to include it as a parameter. However, if you do not call next then no following middleware functions will be invoked for the request.

## Using middleware

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [Express Middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware.html)

The standard [Mediator/Middleware](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/mediator-pattern/) design pattern has two pieces: A mediator and middleware. Middleware represents componentized pieces of functionality. The mediator loads the middleware components and determines their order of execution. When a request comes to the mediator it then passes the request around to the middleware components. Following this pattern, Express is the mediator, and middleware functions are the middleware components.

Express comes with a standard set of middleware functions. These provide functionality like routing, authentication, CORS, sessions, serving static web files, cookies, and logging. Some middleware functions are provided by default, and other ones must be installed using NPM before you can use it. You can also write your own middleware functions and use them with Express.

A middleware function looks very similar to a routing function. That is because routing functions are also middleware functions. The only difference is that routing functions are only called if the associated pattern matches. Middleware functions are always called for every HTTP request unless a preceding middleware function does not call `next`. A middleware function has the following pattern:

```js
function middlewareName(req, res, next)
```

The middleware function parameters represent the HTTP request object (`req`), the HTTP response object (`res`), and the `next` middleware function to pass processing to. You should usually call the `next` function after completing processing so that the next middleware function can execute.

![Middleware](webServicesMiddleware.jpg)

### Creating your own middleware

As an example of writing your own middleware, you can create a function that logs out the URL of the request and then passes on processing to the next middleware function.

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.originalUrl);
  next();
});
```

Remember that the order that you add your middleware to the Express app object controls the order that the middleware functions are called. Any middleware that does not call the next function after doing its processing, stops the middleware chain from continuing.

### Builtin middleware

In addition to creating your own middleware functions, you can use a built-in middleware function. Here is an example of using the `static` middleware function. This middleware responds with static files, found in a given directory, that match the request URL.

```js
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

Now if you create a subdirectory in your project directory and name it `public` you can serve up any static content that you would like. For example, you could create an `index.html` file that is the default content for your web service. Then when you call your web service without any path the index.html file will be returned.

### Third party middleware

You can also use third party middleware functions by using NPM to install the package and including the package in your JavaScript with the `require` function. The following uses the `cookie-parser` package to simplify the generation and access of cookies.

```sh
➜ npm install cookie-parser
```

```js
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

app.use(cookieParser());

app.post('/cookie/:name/:value', (req, res, next) => {
  res.cookie(req.params.name, req.params.value);
  res.send({ cookie: `${req.params.name}:${req.params.value}` });
});

app.get('/cookie', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({ cookie: req.cookies });
});
```

It is common for middleware functions to add fields and functions to the `req` and `res` object so that other middleware can access the functionality they provide. You see this happening when the cookie-parser middleware adds the `req.cookies` object for reading cookies, and also adds the `res.cookie` function in order to make it easy to add a cookie to a response.

## Error handling middleware

You can also add middleware for handling errors that occur. Error middleware looks similar to other middleware functions, but it takes an additional `err` parameter that contains the error.

```js
function errorMiddlewareName(err, req, res, next)
```

If you wanted to add a simple error handler for anything that might go wrong while process HTTP requests you could add the following.

```js
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  res.status(500).send({ type: err.name, message: err.message });
});
```

We can test that our error middleware is getting used by adding a new endpoint that generates an error.

```js
app.get('/error', (req, res, next) => {
  throw new Error('Trouble in river city');
});
```

Now if we use curl to call our error endpoint we can see that the response comes from the error middleware.

```sh
➜ curl localhost:8080/error
{"type":"Error","message":"Trouble in river city"}
```

## Putting it all together

Here is a full example of our web service built using Express.

```js
const express = require('express');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
const app = express();

// Third party middleware - Cookies
app.use(cookieParser());

app.post('/cookie/:name/:value', (req, res, next) => {
  res.cookie(req.params.name, req.params.value);
  res.send({ cookie: `${req.params.name}:${req.params.value}` });
});

app.get('/cookie', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({ cookie: req.cookies });
});

// Creating your own middleware - logging
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.originalUrl);
  next();
});

// Built in middleware - Static file hosting
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Routing middleware
app.get('/store/:storeName', (req, res) => {
  res.send({ name: req.params.storeName });
});

app.put('/st*/:storeName', (req, res) => res.send({ update: req.params.storeName }));

app.delete(/\/store\/(.+)/, (req, res) => res.send({ delete: req.params[0] }));

// Error middleware
app.get('/error', (req, res, next) => {
  throw new Error('Trouble in river city');
});

app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  res.status(500).send({ type: err.name, message: err.message });
});

// Listening to a network port
const port = 8080;
app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

# Debugging Node.js

🔑 **Required reading**: [Debugging a Node.js application](https://youtu.be/B0le_Z_2TQY)

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [Node.js debugging in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging)

Previously your JavaScript debugging was done by running the `Live Server` VS Code extension and using the browser's debugging tools as it executed in the browser. Now that you are writing JavaScript that runs using Node.js, you need a way to launch and debug your code that runs outside of the browser. One great way to do that is to use the debugging tools built into VS Code. To debug JavaScript in VS Code you first need some JavaScript to debug. Open up VS Code and create a new file named `main.js` and paste the following code into the file.

```js
let x = 1 + 1;

console.log(x);

function double(x) {
  return x * 2;
}

x = double(x);

console.log(x);
```

You can now debug `main.js` in VS Code by executing the `Start Debugging` command by pressing `F5`. The first time you run this, VS Code will ask you what debugger you want to use. Select `node.js`.

![Debug start](webServicesDebugStart.png)

The code will execute and the debug console window will automatically open to show you the debugger output where you can see the results of the two console.log statements found in the code.

![Debug output](webServicesDebugOutput.png)

You can pause execution of the code by setting a breakpoint. Move your cursor over to the far left side of the editor window. As you hover on the left side of the line numbers you will see a red dot appear. Click on the dot to set the breakpoint.

![Debug output](webServicesDebugBreakpoint.png)

Now start the debugger again by pressing `F5`. The code will start running, but pause on the line with the breakpoint. You can then see the values of variables by looking at the variable window on the left, or by hovering your mouse over the variable you would like to inspect.

![Debug pause](webServicesDebugPaused.png)

You can continue execution of the code by pressing `F10` to step to the next line, `F11` to step into a function call, or `F5` to continue running from the current line. When the last line of code executes the debugger will automatically exit and you will need to press `F5` to start it running again. You can stop debugging at any time by pressing `SHIFT-F5`.

Experiment with this simple file until you are comfortable running the debugger, setting breakpoints, and inspecting variables.

## Debugging a Node.js web service

In order to debug a web service running under Node.js we first need to write our code. Replace the code in your main.js file with the following.

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/*', (req, res) => {
  res.send({ url: req.originalUrl });
});

const port = 8080;
app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

Switch to your console application and run `npm init -y` and `npm install express` from your code directory so that we can use the Express package to write a simple web service.

Now we are ready to debug again. Set a breakpoint on the getStore endpoint callback (line 5) and the app.listen call (line 9). Start debugging by pressing `F5`. The debugger should stop on the listen call where you can inspect the `app` variable. Press `F5` again to continue running. Now open up your browser and set the location to `localhost:8080`. This should hit the breakpoint on the endpoint. Take some time to inspect the `req` object. You should be able to see what the HTTP method is, what parameters are provided, and what the path currently is. Press `F5` to continue.

Your browser should display the JSON object, containing the URL, that you returned from your endpoint. Now change the URL in the browser to include a path and some query parameters. Something like `http://localhost:8080/fish/taco?order=2`. Requesting that URL should cause your breakpoint to hit again where you can see the URL changes reflected in the req object.

Now, instead of pressing `F5` to continue, press `F11` to step into the `res.send` function. This will take you out of your code and into the express code that handles sending a response. Because you installed the Express package using NPM, all of Express' source code is sitting in the `node_modules` directory. You can also set breakpoints there, examine variables, and step into functions. Debugging into popular packages is a great way to learn how to code by seeing how really good programmers do things. Take some time to walk around Holowaychuk's code and see if you can understand what it is doing.

![Debug step in](webServicesDebugStepIn.png)

## Nodemon

Once you start writing complex web applications you will find yourself making changes in the middle of debugging sessions and you would like have node restart automatically and update the browser as the changes are saved. This seems like a simple thing, but over the course of hundreds of changes, every second you can save really starts to add up.

The [Nodemon package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is basically a wrapper around node that watches for files in the project directory to change. When it detects that you saved something it will automatically restart node.

If you would like to experiment with this then take the following steps. First install Nodemon globally so that you can use it to debug all of your projects.

```sh
npm install -g nodemon
```

Then, because VS Code does not know how to launch nodemon automatically, you need create a VS Code launch configuration. In VS Code press `CTRL-SHIFT-P` (on Windows) or `⌘-⇧-P` (on Mac) and type the command `Debug: Add configuration`. This will then ask you what type of configuration you would like to create. Type `Node.js` and select the `Node.js: Nodemon setup` option. in the launch configuration file at it creates, change the program from `app.js` to `main.js` (or whatever the main JavaScript file is for your application) and save the configuration file.

Now when you press `F5` to start debugging it will run Nodemon instead of Node.js and your changes will automatically update your application when you save.

# PM2

When you run a program from the console the program will automatically terminate when you close the console or if the computer restarts. In order to keep programs running after a shutdown you need to register it as a `daemon`. The term daemon comes from the idea of something that is always there working in the background. Hopefully you only have good daemons running in your background.

We want our web services to continue running as a daemon. We would also like a easy way to start and stop our services. That is what [Process Manager 2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) (PM2) does.

PM2 is already installed on your production server as part of the AWS AMI that you selected when you launched your server. Additionally, the deployment scripts found with the Simon projects automatically modify PM2 to register and restart your web services. That means you should not need to do anything with PM2. However, if you run into problems such as your services are not running, then here are some commands that you might find useful.

You can SSH into your server and see PM2 in action by running the following command.

```sh
pm2 ls
```

This should print out the two services, simon and startup, that are configured to run on your web server.

You can try some of the other commands, but only if you understand what they are doing. Using them incorrectly could cause your web services to stop working.

## Registering a new web service

If you want to setup another subdomain that accesses a different web service on your web server, you need to follow these steps.

1. Add the rule to the Caddyfile to tell it how to direct requests for the domain.
2. Create a directory and add the files for the web service.
3. Configure PM2 to host the web service.

### Modify Caddyfile

SSH into your server.

Copy the section for the startup subdomain and alter it so that it represents the desired subdomain and give it a different port number that is not currently used on your server. For example:

```sh
tacos.cs260.click {
  reverse_proxy _ localhost:5000
  header Cache-Control none
  header -server
  header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *
}
```

This tells Caddy that when it gets a request for tacos.cs260.click it will act as a proxy for those requests and pass them on to the web service that is listening on the same machine (localhost), on port 5000. The other settings tell Caddy to return headers that disable caching, hide the fact that Caddy is the server (no reason to tell hackers anything about your server), and to allow any other origin server to make endpoint requests to this subdomain (basically disabling CORS). Depending on what your web service does you may want different settings.

Restart Caddy to cause it to load the new settings.

```sh
sudo service caddy restart
```

Now Caddy will attempt to proxy the requests, but there is no web service listening on port 5000 and so you will get an error from Caddy if you make a request to tacos.cs260.click.

### Create the web service

Copy the ~/services/startup directory to a directory that represents the purpose of your service. For example:

cp -r ~/services/startup ~/services/tacos

If you list the directory you should see an `index.js` file that is the main JavaScript file for your web service. It has the code to listen on the designated network port and respond to requests. The following is the JavaScript that causes the web service to listen on a port that is provided as an argument to the command line.

```js
const port = process.argv.length > 2 ? process.argv[2] : 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

There is also a directory named `public` that has static HTML/CSS/JavaScript files that your web service will respond with when requested. The index.js file enables this with the following code:

```js
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

You can start up the web service, listening on port 5000, using Node as follows.

```sh
node index.js 5000
```

You can now access your web service through the browser, or curl.

```sh
curl https://tacos.cs260.click
```

Caddy will receive the request and map the subdomain name, tacos.cs260.click, to a request for https://localhost:5000. Your web service is listening on port 5000 and so it receives the request and responds.

Stop your web service by pressing CTRL-C in the SSH console that you used to start the service. Now your browser request for your subdomain should return an error again.

### Configure PM2 to host the web service

The problem with running your web service from the console with `node index.js 5000`, is that as soon as you close your SSH session it will terminate all processes you started in that session, including your web service. Instead you need something that is always running in the background to run your web service. This is where daemons come into play. The daemon we use to do this is called PM2.

From your SSH console session run:

```sh
pm2 ls
```

This will list the web services that you already have registered with PM2. To run your newly created web service under PM2, make sure you are in your service directory, and run the command similar to the following, with the service name and port substituted to your desired values:

```sh
cd ~/services/tacos
pm2 start index.js -n tacos -- 5000
pm2 save
```

If you run `pm2 ls` again you should see your web service listed. You can now access your subdomain in the browser and see the proper response. PM2 will keep running your service even after you exit your SSH session.

# UI testing

[Test driven development](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/test-driven-development-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not-41fa6bca02a2/) (TDD) is a proven methodology for accelerating application creation, protecting against regression bugs, and demonstrating correctness. TDD for console based applications and server based code is fairly straight forward. Web application UI code is significantly more complex to test, and using automated tests to drive your UI development is even more difficult.

The problem is that a browser is required to execute UI code. That means you have to actually test the application in the browser. Additionally, every one of the major browsers behaves slightly differently, viewport size makes a big difference, all the code executes asynchronously, network disruptions are common, and then there is the human factor. A human will interact with the browser in very unexpected ways. Clicking where they shouldn't, clicking rapidly, randomly refreshing the browser, flushing cache, not flushing cache, leaving the application up for days on end, switching between tabs, opening the application multiple times, logging in on different tabs, logging out of one tab while still using the application on another tab, or ... on and on. And we haven't even talked about running all the different browsers on all of the possible devices.

Of course the alternative to not test your code doesn't work either. That only means that you have to manually test everything every time you make any change, or you let your users test everything. That is not a good recipe for long term success.

Fortunately this is a problem that many strong players have been working on for decades now, and the solutions, while not perfect, are getting better and better. We will look at two of these solutions. One is for executing automated tests in the browser, and the other is for testing on different browsers and devices.

## Automating the browser - Playwright

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [Playwright and VS Code](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-VSCode)

No one understands the difficulty of testing applications in a browser better than the companies that build web browsers. They have to test every possible use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that a user could think of. There is no way that manual testing is going to work and so early on they started putting hooks into their browsers that allowed them to be driven from automated external processes. [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) was introduced in 2004 as the first popular tool to automate the browser. However, Selenium is generally considered to be flaky and slow. Flakiness means that a test fails in unpredictably, unreproducible, ways. When you need thousands of tests to pass before you can deploy a new feature, even a little flakiness becomes a big problem. If those tests take hours to run then you have an even bigger problem.

The market now has lots of alternatives when considering which automated browser framework to use. State of JS includes statistics on how popular these frameworks are. With frameworks coming and going all of the time, one telling statistic is the frameworks ability to retain users.

![State of JS testing](javascriptStateOfJsTesting.jpg)

— Retention of browser based testing frameworks (**Source**: _2021.stateofjs.com_)

For the purposes of this instruction, we could pick any of the top contenders. However, we are going to pick a newcomer, [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). Playwright has some major advantages. It is backed by Microsoft, it integrates really well with VS Code, and it runs as a Node.js process. It is also considered one of the least flaky of the testing frameworks.

As a demonstration of using Playwright, consider the following simplified HTML file containing a button that changes the paragraph text. The button calls a JavaScript function defined in a script element located in the HTML file.

```HTML
<body>
  <p id="welcome" data-testid="msg">Hello world</p>
  <button onclick="changeWelcome()">change welcome</button>
  <script>
    function changeWelcome() {
      const welcomeEl = document.querySelector('#welcome');
      welcomeEl.textContent = 'I feel welcomed';
    }
  </script>
</body>
```

First, you need to install Playwright. In your project directory, use NPM to download the playwright packages, install the browser drivers, configure your project, and create a couple example test files.

```sh
npm init playwright@latest
```

Next, you want to install the Playwright extension for VS Code. Go to the extensions tab in VS Code and search for, and install, `Playwright Test for VSCode`.

You can now write your first Playwright test. Take the following and paste it over the `tests/example.spec.js` file that the Playwright install created.

```js
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('testWelcomeButton', async ({ page }) => {
  // Navigate to the welcome page
  await page.goto('http://localhost:5500/');

  // Get the target element and make sure it is in the correct starting state
  const hello = page.getByTestId('msg');
  await expect(hello).toHaveText('Hello world');

  // Press the button
  const changeBtn = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'change welcome' });
  await changeBtn.click();

  // Expect that the change happened correctly
  await expect(hello).toHaveText('I feel not welcomed');
});
```

This test makes sure you can successfully navigate to the desired page, that the page contains the desired elements, that you can press the button and the text changes as expected.

Before you run the test, you actually need your application running for the test to execute against. You can do this by using the VS Code Live Server extension, or if you are testing a Node.js based service then run `npm run start`. You can actually add configuration to your tests so that your application is started when your tests run, but for now, just start up your application before you run the test.

To run the test in VS Code, select the `Test Explorer` tab. You should see your test listed in the explorer. Select the `example.spec.ts` test and press the play button. This will start the test, launch a browser, run the test code to interact with the browser, and display the result. In this case our test fails because it is expecting the resulting test to be `I feel not welcomed` when it actually displays `I feel welcomed`.

The following image should be similar to what you see. You can see the listing of tests on the left and the JavaScript based test in the editor window on the right. When a test fails the editor window displays a clear description of what went wrong. You can even debug the tests as they execute just like you would any other Node.js based JavaScript execution.

![Playwright](javaScriptPlaywright.png)

You can fix the test by either changing `index.html` or `test/example.spec.js` so that the text matches. Once you have done that you can run the test again and the test explorer should display a green check box.

This is just a simple example of the powerful functionality of Playwright. You are encouraged to explore its functionality and even add some tests to your projects. Once you have gained some competency with Playwright you will find that you can write your code faster and feel more confident when changing things around.

## Testing various devices - Browser Stack

With the ability to run automated UI tests, we now turn our attention to testing on the multitude of various devices. There are several services out there that help with this. One of these is [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/). BrowserStack lets you pick from a long list of physical devices that you can run interactively, or use when driving automated tests with Selenium. The image below only shows a partial list of iPhone devices. BrowserStack also has devices for Android, Mac, and Windows.

![BrowserStack devices](javaScriptBrowserStackDevices.png)

When you launch a device it connects the browser interface to a physical device hosted in a data center. You can then use the device to reproduce user reported problems, or validate that your implementation works on that specific device. The following image shows the use of BrowserStack to experiment with an iPhone 14 running iOS 16.

![BrowserStack iPhone](javaScriptBrowserStackIPhone.png)

BrowserStack offers free trials if you would like to see how your start up application works on a specific device.

# Endpoint testing

Using test driven development (TDD) for testing service endpoints is a common industry practice. Testing services is usually easier than writing UI tests because it does not require a browser. However, it does still take effort to learn how to write tests that are effective and efficient. Making this a standard part of your development process will give you a significant advantage as you progress in your professional career.

As demonstrated by the following [State of JS](https://2021.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/testing/) survey, there are lots of good testing packages that work well with Express driven services. We are going to look at the current champion [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

![State of JS Testing](webServicesStateOfJsEndpointTesting.jpg)

To get started with Jest we need a simple web service. In a console window, create a test directory, install Express, and open up VS Code.

```sh
mkdir testJest
cd testJest
npm init -y
npm install express
code .
```

Now create a file named `server.js` and use Express to create an application with two endpoints. One to get a store (getStore), and another to update a store.

**server.js**

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

// Endpoints
app.get('/store/:storeName', (req, res) => {
  res.send({ name: req.params.storeName });
});

app.put('/store/:storeName', (req, res) => {
  req.body.updated = true;
  res.send(req.body);
});

module.exports = app;
```

In order to allow Jest to startup the HTTP server when running tests, we initialize the application a little bit differently than we have in the past. Normally, we would have just started listening on the Express app object after we defined our endpoints. Instead we export the Express app object from our `server.js` file and then import the app object in the `index.js` file that is used to run our service.

**index.js**

```js
const app = require('./server');

const port = 8080;
app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

Breaking apart the definition of the service from the starting of the service allows us to start the service both when we run normally and also when using our testing framework.

![Jest endpoint requests](endpointTestingJest.jpg)

You can test that the service is working properly by running the service in the VS Code debugger and pressing F5 while viewing the index.js file. Then open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/store/provo`. Stop the debugging session once you have demonstrated that the service is working correctly.

To launch the service using Jest we create another file that has a suffix of `.test.js`. Any file with that suffix is considered a testing file and will automatically be discovered by Jest and examined for tests to run.

## A simple test

Before we write tests for our endpoints we will write a simple test that demonstrates how Jest works. A test is created by calling the Jest `test` function. Note that you don't need to include a `require` statement to import Jest functions into your code. Jest will automatically import itself when it discovers a test file.

Let's make our first test by creating a file named `store.test.js` and pasting in the following code.

**store.test.js**

```js
test('that equal values are equal', () => {
  expect(false).toBe(true);
});
```

The `test` function takes a description as the first parameter. The description is meant to be human readable. In this case it reads: "test that equal values are equal". The second parameter is the function to call. Our function just calls the Jest `expect` function and chains it to the `toBe` function. You can read this as "expect false to be true", which is of course is not true, but we want to see our test fail the first time we run it. We will fix this later so that we can show what happens when a test succeeds.

In order to run the test we need to install the Jest package using NPM. From the console install the package. The `-D` parameter tells NPM to install Jest as a development package. That keeps it from being included when we do production release builds.

```sh
npm install jest -D
```

Now, replace the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file with a new command that will run our tests with Jest.

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
},
```

With that in place we can run the `test` command and our test will execute. Notice that Jest shows exactly where the test failed and what expected values were not received.

```sh
➜ npm run test

 FAIL  ./store.test.js
  ✕ that unequal values are not equal (1 ms)

  ● that unequal values are not equal

    expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

    Expected: true
    Received: false

      3 |
      4 | test('that unequal values are not equal', () => {
    > 5 |   expect(false).toBe(true);
        |                 ^
      6 | });
      7 |
      8 | // describe('endpoints', () => {

      at Object.toBe (store.test.js:5:17)

Tests:       1 failed, 1 total
```

We can then fix our test by rewriting it so that the expected value matches the provided value.

**store.test.js**

```js
test('that equal values are equal', () => {
  expect(true).toBe(true);
});
```

This time when we run the test it passes.

```sh
➜  npm run test

 PASS  ./store.test.js
  ✓ that equal values are equal (1 ms)

Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
```

Note that this example didn't actually test any of our code, but it does demonstrate how easy it is to write tests. A real test function would call code in your program. Let's do this by actually making calls to our endpoints.

## Testing endpoints

To test our endpoints we need another package so that we can make HTTP requests without having to actually send them over the network. This is done with the NPM package called `supertest`. Go ahead and install this now.

```sh
npm install supertest -D
```

We can then alter `store.test.js` to import our Express service and also the request function from supertest that we will use to make HTTP requests.

To make an HTTP request you pass the Express app to the supertest request function and then chain on the HTTP verb function that you want to call, along with the endpoint path. You can then chain on as many `expect` functions as you would like. In the following example we will expect an HTTP status code of 200 (OK), and that the body of the response contains the object that we expect the endpoint to return.

If something goes wrong, the `end` function will contain an error and we pass the error along to the `done` function. Otherwise we just call `done` without the error.

**store.test.js**

```js
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('./server');

test('getStore returns the desired store', (done) => {
  request(app)
    .get('/store/provo')
    .expect(200)
    .expect({ name: 'provo' })
    .end((err) => (err ? done(err) : done()));
});
```

When we run this test we see that it passes without error.

```sh
➜  npm run test

 PASS  ./store.test.js
  ✓ getStore returns the desired store (16 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.237 s, estimated 1 s
```

You can change the test to expect a status code of 500 (Server Error) if you want to see the test fail. You can also change the endpoint code to return a 201 status code (Created) and also see the test fail.

Now We can add a test for the updateStore endpoint. To do this we can copy the getStore endpoint, change the description, change the HTTP function verb to `put`, and send the body of the put request using the chained `send` function.

```js
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('./server');

test('updateStore saves the correct values', (done) => {
  request(app)
    .put('/store/provo')
    .send({ items: ['fish', 'milk'] })
    .expect(200)
    .expect({ items: ['fish', 'milk'], updated: true })
    .end((err) => (err ? done(err) : done()));
});

test('getStore returns the desired store', (done) => {
  request(app)
    .get('/store/provo')
    .expect(200)
    .expect({ name: 'provo' })
    .end((err) => (err ? done(err) : done()));
});
```

The great thing about test driven development (TDD) is that you can actually write your tests first and then write your code based upon the design represented by the tests. When your tests pass you know your code is complete. Additionally, when you make later modifications to your code you can simply run your tests again. If they pass then you can be confident that your code is still working without having to manually test everything yourself. With systems that have hundreds of endpoints and hundreds of thousands of lines of code, TDD becomes an indispensible part of the development process.

# Storage services

Web applications commonly need to store files associated with the application or the users of the application. This includes files such as images, user uploads, documents, and movies. Files usually have an ID, some metadata, and the bytes representing the file itself. These can be stored using a database service, but usually that is overkill and a simpler solution will be cheaper.

It might be tempting to store files directly on your server. This is usually a bad idea for several reasons.

1. Your server has limited drive space. If you server runs out of drive space your entire application will fail.
1. You should consider your server as being ephemeral, or temporary. It can be thrown away and replaced by a copy at any time. If you start storing files on the server, then your server has state that cannot be easily replaced.
1. You need backup copies of your application and user files. If you only have one copy of your files on your server, then they will disappears when your server disappears, and you must always assume that your server will disappear.

Instead you want to use a storage service that is specifically designed to support production storage and delivery of files.

There are many such solutions out there, but one of the most popular ones is [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). S3 provides the following advantages:

1. It has unlimited capacity
1. You only pay for the storage that you use
1. It is optimized for global access
1. It keeps multiple redundant copies of every file
1. You can version the files
1. It is performant
1. It supports metadata tags
1. You can make your files publicly available directly from S3
1. You can keep your files private and only accessible to your application

In this course we will not be using an storage services for the Simon project. If however, you want to use S3 as the storage service for your Startup application then you need to learn how to use the AWS SDK. You can find detailed information about using AWS S3 with Node.js on the [AWS website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/getting-started-nodejs.html). Generally, the steps you need to take include:

1. Creating a S3 bucket to store your data in.
1. Getting credentials so that your application can access the bucket.
1. [Using](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) the credentials in your application.
1. Using the [SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/s3-example-creating-buckets.html) to write, list, read, and delete files from the bucket.

⚠ Make sure that you do not include your credentials in your code. If you check your credentials into your GitHub repository they will immediately be stolen and used by hackers to take over your AWS account. This may result in significant monetary damage to you.

# Data services

Web applications commonly need to store application and user data persistently. The data can be many things, but it is usually a representation of complex interrelated objects. This includes this like a user profile, organizational structure, game play information, usage history, billing information, peer relationship, library catalog, and so forth.

![Data service](dataService.jpg)

Historically SQL databases have served as the general purpose data service solution, but starting around 2010 specialty data services that better support document, graph, JSON, time, sequence, and key-value pair data began to take significant roles in applications from major companies. These data services are often called NoSQL solutions because they do not use the general purpose relational database paradigms popularized by SQL databases. However, they all have very different underlying data structures, strengths, and weaknesses. That means that you should not simply split all of the possible data services into two narrowly defined boxes, SQL and NoSQL, when you are considering the right data service for your application.

Here is a list of some of the popular data services that are available.

| Service       | Specialty             |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| MySQL         | Relational queries    |
| Redis         | Memory cached objects |
| ElasticSearch | Ranked free text      |
| MongoDB       | JSON objects          |
| DynamoDB      | Key value pairs       |
| Neo4J         | Graph based data      |
| InfluxDB      | Time series data      |

## MongoDB

![MongoDB logo](webServicesMongoLogo.png)

For the projects in this course that require data services, we will use `MongoDB`. Mongo increases developer productivity by using JSON objects as its core data model. This makes it easy to have an application that uses JSON from the top to the bottom of the technology stack. A mongo database is made up of one or more collections that each contain JSON documents. You can think of a collection as a large array of JavaScript objects, each with a unique ID. The following is a sample of a collection of houses that are for rent.

```js
[
  {
    _id: '62300f5316f7f58839c811de',
    name: 'Lovely Loft',
    summary: 'A charming loft in Paris',
    beds: 1,
    last_review: {
      $date: '2022-03-15T04:06:17.766Z',
    },
    price: 3000,
  },
  {
    _id: '623010b97f1fed0a2df311f8',
    name: 'Infinite Views',
    summary: 'Modern home with infinite views from the infinity pool',
    property_type: 'House',
    beds: 5,
    price: 250,
  },
];
```

Unlike relational databases that require a rigid table definition where each column must be strictly typed and defined beforehand, Mongo has no strict schema requirements. Each document in the collection usually follows a similar schema, but each document may have specialized fields that are present, and common fields that are missing. This allows the schema of a collection to morph organically as the data model of the application evolves. To add a new field to a Mongo collection you just start insert the field into the documents as desired. If the field is not present, or has a different type in some documents, then the document simply doesn't match the query criteria when the field is referenced.

The query syntax for Mongo also follow a JavaScript inspired flavor. Consider the following queries on the houses for rent collection that was shown above.

```js
// find all houses
db.house.find();

// find houses with two or more bedrooms
db.house.find({ beds: { $gte: 2 } });

// find houses that are available with less than three beds
db.house.find({ status: 'available', beds: { $lt: 3 } });

// find houses with either less than three beds or less than $1000 a night
db.house.find({ $or: [(beds: { $lt: 3 }), (price: { $lt: 1000 })] });

// find houses with the text 'modern' or 'beach' in the summary
db.house.find({ summary: /(modern|beach)/i });
```

### Using MongoDB in your application

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MongoDB tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/javascript/node-crud-tutorial/)

The first step to using Mongo in your application is to install the `mongodb` package using NPM.

```sh
➜ npm install mongodb
```

With that done you then use the `MongoClient` object to make a client connection to the database server. This requires a username, password, and the hostname of the database server.

```js
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

const userName = 'holowaychuk';
const password = 'express';
const hostname = 'mongodb.com';

const uri = `mongodb+srv://${userName}:${password}@${hostname}`;

const client = new MongoClient(uri);
```

With the client connection you can then get a database object and from that a collection object. The collection object allows you to insert, and query for, documents. You do not have to do anything special to insert a JavaScript object as a Mongo document. You just call the `insertOne` function on the collection object and pass it the JavaScript object. When you insert a document, if the database or collection does not exists, Mongo will automatically create them for you. When the document is inserted into the collection it will automatically be assigned a unique ID.

```js
const collection = client.db('rental').collection('house');

const house = {
  name: 'Beachfront views',
  summary: 'From your bedroom to the beach, no shoes required',
  property_type: 'Condo',
  beds: 1,
};
await collection.insertOne(house);
```

To query for documents you use the `find` function on the collection object. Note that the find function is asynchronous and so we use the `await` keyword to wait for the promise to resolve before we write them out to the console.

```js
const cursor = collection.find();
const rentals = await cursor.toArray();
rentals.forEach((i) => console.log(i));
```

If you do not supply any parameters to the `find` function then it will return all documents in the collection. In this case we only get back the single document that we previously inserted. Notice that the automatically generated ID is returned with the document.

**Output**

```js
[
  {
    _id: new ObjectId('639a96398f8de594e198fc13'),
    name: 'Beachfront views',
    summary: 'From your bedroom to the beach, no shoes required',
    property_type: 'Condo',
    beds: 1,
  },
];
```

You can provide a query and options to the `find` function. In the example below we query for a `property_type` of Condo that has less than two bedrooms. We also specify the options to sort by descending price, and limit our results to the first 10 documents.

```js
const query = { property_type: 'Condo', beds: { $lt: 2 } };

const options = {
  sort: { price: -1 },
  limit: 10,
};

const cursor = collection.find(query, options);
const rentals = await cursor.toArray();
rentals.forEach((i) => console.log(i));
```

The query matches the document that we previously inserted and so we get the same result as before.

There is a lot more functionality that MongoDB provides, but this is enough to get you started. If you are interested you can explore the tutorials on their [website](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/).

## Managed services

Historically each application development team would have developers that managed the data service. Those developers would acquisition hardware, install the database software, monitor the memory, cpu, and disk space, control the data schema, and handle migrations and upgrades. Much of this work has now moved to services that are hosted and managed by a 3rd party. This relieves the development team from much of the day to day maintenance. The team can instead focus more on the application and less on the infrastructure. With a managed data service you simply supply the data and the service grows, or shrinks, to support the desired capacity and performance criteria.

### MongoDB Atlas

All of the major cloud providers offer multiple data services. For this class we will use the data service provided by MongoDB called [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database). No credit card or payment is required to setup and use Atlas, as long as you stick to the shared cluster environment.

[![Mongo sign up](webServicesMongoSignUp.jpg)](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)

⚠ This [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daIH4o75KE8) will step you through the process of creating your account and setting up your database. You really want to watch this video. Note that some of the Atlas website interface may be slightly different, but the basic concepts should all be there is some shape or form. The main steps you need to take are:

1. Create your account.
1. Create a database cluster.
1. Create your root database user credentials. Remember these for later use.
1. ⚠ Set network access to your database to be available from anywhere.

   ![Atlas IP Anywhere](webServicesMongoIpAnywhere.gif)

1. Copy the connection string and use the information in your code.
1. Save the connection and credential information in your production and development environments as instructed above.

You can always find the connection string to your Atlas cluster by pressing the `Connect` button from your Database > DataServices view.

![Atlas connection string](webServicesMongoConnection.gif)

## Keeping your keys out of your code

You need to protect your credentials for connecting to your Mongo database. One common mistake is to check them into your code and then post it to a public GitHub repository. Instead you can load your credentials when the application executes. One common way to do that is to have a JSON configuration file that contains the credentials that you dynamically load into the JavaScript that makes the database connection. You then use the configuration file in your development environment and deploy it to your production environment, but you **never** commit it to GitHub.

In order to accomplish this do the following:

1. Create a file named `dbConfig.json` in the same directory as the database JavaScript (e.g. `database.js`) that you use to make database requests.
1. Insert your Mongo DB credentials into the `dbConfig.json` file in JSON format using the following example:

   ```json
   {
     "hostname": "cs260.abcdefg.mongodb.net",
     "userName": "myMongoUserName",
     "password": "toomanysecrets"
   }
   ```

1. Import the `dbConfig.json` content into your database.js file using a Node.js require statement and use the data that it represents to create the connection URL.

   ```js
   const config = require('./dbConfig.json');
   const url = `mongodb+srv://${config.userName}:${config.password}@${config.hostname}`;
   ```

⚠ Make sure you include `dbConfig.json` in your `.gitignore` file so that it does not get pushed up to GitHub.

### Testing the connection on startup

It is nice to know that your connection string is correct before your application attempts to access any data. We can do that when the application starts by making an asynchronous request to ping the database. If that fails than either the connection string is incorrect, the credentials are invalid, or the network is not working. The following is an example of testing the Connection

```js
const config = require('./dbConfig.json');

const url = `mongodb+srv://${config.userName}:${config.password}@${config.hostname}`;
const client = new MongoClient(url);
const db = client.db('rental');

(async function testConnection() {
  await client.connect();
  await db.command({ ping: 1 });
})().catch((ex) => {
  console.log(`Unable to connect to database with ${url} because ${ex.message}`);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

If your server is not starting, then check your logs for this exception being thrown.

## Using Mongo from your code

With that all done, you should be good to use Atlas from both your development and production environments. You can test that things are working correctly with the following example.

```js
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
const config = require('./dbConfig.json');

async function main() {
  // Connect to the database cluster
  const url = `mongodb+srv://${config.userName}:${config.password}@${config.hostname}`;
  const client = new MongoClient(url);
  const db = client.db('rental');
  const collection = db.collection('house');

  // Test that you can connect to the database
  (async function testConnection() {
    await client.connect();
    await db.command({ ping: 1 });
  })().catch((ex) => {
    console.log(`Unable to connect to database with ${url} because ${ex.message}`);
    process.exit(1);
  });

  // Insert a document
  const house = {
    name: 'Beachfront views',
    summary: 'From your bedroom to the beach, no shoes required',
    property_type: 'Condo',
    beds: 1,
  };
  await collection.insertOne(house);

  // Query the documents
  const query = { property_type: 'Condo', beds: { $lt: 2 } };
  const options = {
    sort: { score: -1 },
    limit: 10,
  };

  const cursor = collection.find(query, options);
  const rentals = await cursor.toArray();
  rentals.forEach((i) => console.log(i));
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

To execute the above example, do the following:

1. Create a directory called `mongoTest`
1. Save the above content to a file named `index.js`
1. Create a file named `dbConfig.json` that contains your database credentials
1. Run `npm init -y`
1. Run `npm install mongodb`
1. Run `node index.js`.

This should output something like the following if everything is working correctly.

```js
{
_id: new ObjectId("639b51b74ef1e953b884ca5b"),
name: 'Beachfront views',
summary: 'From your bedroom to the beach, no shoes required',
property_type: 'Condo',
beds: 1
}
```

# ☑ Assignment

First, set up your MongoDB Atlas database service. Then use the instructions aboveRun the example program for testing that you have things set up correctly.

When you are done submit the connection string for your Atlas database cluster to the Canvas assignment.

Here is an example connection string:

```
mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cs260.xiu1cqz.mongodb.net/
```

⚠ Do not include the user or password for your cluster in the connection string. (Unless you want some extra special data added to your applications 😉.)

# Authorization services

If your application is going to remember a user's data then it will need a way to uniquely associate the data with a particular credential. That usually means that you `authenticate` a user by asking for information, such as an email address and password. You then remember, for some period of time, that the user has authenticated by storing an `authentication token` on the user's device. Often that token is stored in a [cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cookie) that is passed back to your web service on each request. The service can now associate data that the user supplies with a unique identifier that corresponds to their authorization token.

![authentication](authServiceAuthenticate.jpg)

Determining what a user is `authorized` to do in your application is also important. For example, you might have different roles in your application such as Administrators, Editors, and Customers. Once you have the ability to authenticate a user and store information about that user, you can also store the authorization for the user. A simple application might have a single field that represents the role of the user. The service code would then use that role to allow, limit, or prevent what a service endpoint does. A complex web application will usually have very powerful authorization representation that controls the user's access to every part of the application. For example, an Editor role might have authorization only to work on content that they created or were invited to.

![authorize](authServiceAuthorize.jpg)

As you might imagine, authentication and authorization can become very complex, very quickly. It is also a primary target for a hacker. If they can bypass the authentication or escalate what they are authorized to do then they can gain control of your application. Additionally, constantly forcing users to authenticate in a secure way causes users to not want to use an application. This creates opposing priorities. Keep the system secure or make it easy to use.

In an attempt to remove the complexity of authentication and authorization from your application many service providers and package developers have created solutions that you can use. Assuming that you are using a trusted, well tested, service this is an attractive option because it removes the cost of building, testing, and managing that critical infrastructure yourself.

Authorization services often use standard protocols for authenticating and authorizing. These include standards such as [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth), [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language), and [OIDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID). Additionally, they usually support concepts like `Single Sign On` (SSO) and Federated Login. Single sign on allows a user to use the same credentials for multiple web applications. For example, you can login into GitHub using your Google credentials. Federated login allows a user to login once and then the authentication token reused to automatically log the user into multiple websites. For example, logging into Gmail allows you to also use Google Docs and YouTube without logging in again.

For this course we will implement our own authentication using a simple a simple email/password design. Knowing how to implement a simple authentication design will help you appreciate what authentication services provide. If you want to experiment with different authorization services you might consider [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), or [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth).

# Account creation and login

The first step towards supporting authentication in your web application is providing a way for users to uniquely identify themselves. This usually requires two service endpoints. One to initially `create` an authentication credential, and a second to authenticate, or `login`, on future visits. Once a user is authenticated we can control access to other endpoints. For example, web services often have a `getMe` endpoint that gives information about the currently authenticated user. We will implement this endpoint to demonstrate that authentication is actually working correctly.

## Endpoint design

Using HTTP we can map out the design of each of our endpoints.

### Create authentication endpoint

This takes an email and password and returns a cookie containing the authentication token and user ID. If the email already exists it returns a 409 (conflict) status code.

```http
POST /auth/create HTTP/2
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email":"marta@id.com",
  "password":"toomanysecrets"
}
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Set-Cookie: auth=tokenHere

{
  "id":"337"
}
```

### Login authentication endpoint

This takes an email and password and returns a cookie containing the authentication token and user ID. If the email does not exist or the password is bad it returns a 401 (unauthorized) status code.

```http
POST /auth/login HTTP/2
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email":"marta@id.com",
  "password":"toomanysecrets"
}
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Set-Cookie: auth=tokenHere

{
  "id":"337"
}

```

### GetMe endpoint

This uses the authentication token stored in the cookie to look up and return information about the authenticated user. If the token or user do not exist it returns a 401 (unauthorized) status code.

```http
GET /user/me HTTP/2
Cookie: auth=tokenHere
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email":"marta@id.com"
}

```

## Web service

With our service endpoints designed, we can now build our web service using Express.

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.post('/auth/create', async (req, res) => {
  res.send({ id: 'user@id.com' });
});

app.post('/auth/login', async (req, res) => {
  res.send({ id: 'user@id.com' });
});

const port = 8080;
app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

Follow these steps, and then add in the code from the sections that follow. There is a copy of the final version of the example at the end of this instruction. If you get lost, or things are not working as expected, refer to the final version.

1. Create a directory called `authTest` that we will work in.
1. Save the above content to a file named `main.js`. This is our starting web service.
1. Run `npm init -y` to initial the project to work with node.js.
1. Run `npm install express cookie-parser mongodb uuid bcrypt` to install all of the packages we are going to use.
1. Run `node main.js` or press `F5` in VS Code to start up the web service.
1. You can now open a console window and use curl to try out one of the endpoints.

   ```sh
   ➜  curl -X POST localhost:8080/auth/create

   {"id":"user@id.com"}
   ```

## Handling requests

With our basic service created, we can now implement the create authentication endpoint. The first step is to read the credentials from the body of the HTTP request. Since the body is designed to contain JSON we need to tell Express that it should parse HTTP requests, with a content type of `application/json`, automatically into a JavaScript object. We do this by using the `express.json` middleware. We can then read the email and password directly out of the `req.body` object. We can test that this is working by temporarily including them in the response.

```js
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/auth/create', (req, res) => {
  res.send({
    id: 'user@id.com',
    email: req.body.email,
    password: req.body.password,
  });
});
```

```sh
➜  curl -X POST localhost:8080/auth/create -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{"email":"marta@id.com", "password":"toomanysecrets"}'

{"id":"user@id.com","email":"marta@id.com","password":"toomanysecrets"}
```

Now that we have proven that we can parse the request bodies correctly, we can change the code to add a check to see if we already have a user with that email address. If we do, then we immediately return a 409 (conflict) status code. Otherwise we create a new user and return the user ID.

```js
app.post('/auth/create', async (req, res) => {
  if (await getUser(req.body.email)) {
    res.status(409).send({ msg: 'Existing user' });
  } else {
    const user = await createUser(req.body.email, req.body.password);
    res.send({
      id: user._id,
    });
  }
});
```

## Using the database

We want to persistently store our users in Mongo and so we need to set up our code to connect to and use the database. This code is explained in the instruction on data services if you want to review what it is doing.

```js
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

const userName = process.env.MONGOUSER;
const password = process.env.MONGOPASSWORD;
const hostname = process.env.MONGOHOSTNAME;

const url = `mongodb+srv://${userName}:${password}@${hostname}`;
const client = new MongoClient(url);
const collection = client.db('authTest').collection('user');
```

With a Mongo collection object we can implement the `getUser` and `createUser` functions.

```js
function getUser(email) {
  return collection.findOne({ email: email });
}

async function createUser(email, password) {
  const user = {
    email: email,
    password: password,
    token: 'xxx',
  };
  return collection.insertOne(user);
}
```

But, we are missing a couple of things. We need to a real authentication token, and we cannot simply store a clear text password in our database.

## Generating authentication tokens

To generate a reasonable authentication token we use the `uuid` package. [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) stands for Universally Unique Identifier, and it does a really good job creating a hard to guess, random, unique ID.

```js
const uuid = require('uuid');

token: uuid.v4();
```

## Securing passwords

Next we need to securely store our passwords. Failing to do so is a major security concern. If, and it has happened to many major companies, a hacker is able to access the database, they will have the passwords for all of your users. This may not seem like a big deal if your application is not very valuable, but users often reuse passwords. That means you will also provide the hacker with the means to attack the user on many other websites.

So instead of storing the password directly, we want to cryptographically hash the password so that we never store the actual password. When we want to validate a password during login, we can hash the login password and compare it to our stored hash of the password.

To hash our passwords we will use the `bcrypt` package. This creates a very secure one way hash of the password. If you are interested in understanding how [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) works, it is definitely worth the time.

```js
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

async function createUser(email, password) {
  // Hash the password before we insert it into the database
  const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);

  const user = {
    email: email,
    password: passwordHash,
    token: uuid.v4(),
  };
  await collection.insertOne(user);

  return user;
}
```

## Passing authentication tokens

We now need to pass our generated authentication token to the browser when the login endpoint is called, and get it back on subsequent requests. To do this we use HTTP cookies. The `cookie-parser` package provides middleware for cookies and so we will leverage that.

We import the `cookieParser` object and then tell our app to use it. When a user is successfully created, or logs in, we set the cookie header. Since we are storing an authentication token in the cookie we want to make it as secure as possible, and so we use the `httpOnly`, `secure`, and `sameSite` options.

- `httpOnly` tells the browser to not allow JavaScript running on the browser to read the cookie.
- `secure` requires HTTPS to be used when sending the cookie back to the server.
- `sameSite` will only return the cookie to the domain that generated it.

```js
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

// Use the cookie parser middleware
app.use(cookieParser());

apiRouter.post('/auth/create', async (req, res) => {
  if (await DB.getUser(req.body.email)) {
    res.status(409).send({ msg: 'Existing user' });
  } else {
    const user = await DB.createUser(req.body.email, req.body.password);

    // Set the cookie
    setAuthCookie(res, user.token);

    res.send({
      id: user._id,
    });
  }
});

function setAuthCookie(res, authToken) {
  res.cookie('token', authToken, {
    secure: true,
    httpOnly: true,
    sameSite: 'strict',
  });
}
```

## Login endpoint

The login authorization endpoint needs to get the hashed password from the database, compare it to the provided password using `bcrypt.compare`, and if successful set the authentication token in the cookie. If the password does not match, or there is no user with the given email, the endpoint returns status 401 (unauthorized).

```js
app.post('/auth/login', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await getUser(req.body.email);
  if (user) {
    if (await bcrypt.compare(req.body.password, user.password)) {
      setAuthCookie(res, user.token);
      res.send({ id: user._id });
      return;
    }
  }
  res.status(401).send({ msg: 'Unauthorized' });
});
```

## GetMe endpoint

With everything in place to create credentials and login using the credentials, we can now implement the `getMe` endpoint to demonstrate that it all actually works. To implement this we get the user object from the database by querying on the authentication token. If there is not an authentication token, or there is no user with that token, we return status 401 (unauthorized).

```js
app.get('/user/me', async (req, res) => {
  authToken = req.cookies['token'];
  const user = await collection.findOne({ token: authToken });
  if (user) {
    res.send({ email: user.email });
    return;
  }
  res.status(401).send({ msg: 'Unauthorized' });
});
```

## Final code

Here is the full example code.

```js
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
const uuid = require('uuid');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const userName = process.env.MONGOUSER;
const password = process.env.MONGOPASSWORD;
const hostname = process.env.MONGOHOSTNAME;

const url = `mongodb+srv://${userName}:${password}@${hostname}`;
const client = new MongoClient(url);
const collection = client.db('authTest').collection('user');

app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(express.json());

// createAuthorization from the given credentials
app.post('/auth/create', async (req, res) => {
  if (await getUser(req.body.email)) {
    res.status(409).send({ msg: 'Existing user' });
  } else {
    const user = await createUser(req.body.email, req.body.password);
    setAuthCookie(res, user.token);
    res.send({
      id: user._id,
    });
  }
});

// loginAuthorization from the given credentials
app.post('/auth/login', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await getUser(req.body.email);
  if (user) {
    if (await bcrypt.compare(req.body.password, user.password)) {
      setAuthCookie(res, user.token);
      res.send({ id: user._id });
      return;
    }
  }
  res.status(401).send({ msg: 'Unauthorized' });
});

// getMe for the currently authenticated user
app.get('/user/me', async (req, res) => {
  authToken = req.cookies['token'];
  const user = await collection.findOne({ token: authToken });
  if (user) {
    res.send({ email: user.email });
    return;
  }
  res.status(401).send({ msg: 'Unauthorized' });
});

function getUser(email) {
  return collection.findOne({ email: email });
}

async function createUser(email, password) {
  const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
  const user = {
    email: email,
    password: passwordHash,
    token: uuid.v4(),
  };
  await collection.insertOne(user);

  return user;
}

function setAuthCookie(res, authToken) {
  res.cookie('token', authToken, {
    secure: true,
    httpOnly: true,
    sameSite: 'strict',
  });
}

const port = 8080;
app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

## Experiment

With everything implemented we can use curl to try it out. First start up the web service from VS Code by pressing `F5` and selecting `node.js` as the debugger if you have not already done that. You can set breakpoints on all of the different endpoints to see what they do and inspect the different variables. Then open a console window and run the following curl commands. You should see similar results as what is shown below. Note that the `-c` and `-b` parameters tell curl to store and use cookies with the given file.

```sh
➜  curl -X POST localhost:8080/auth/create -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{"email":"지안@id.com", "password":"toomanysecrets"}'

{"id":"639bb9d644416bf7278dde44"}


➜  curl -c cookie.txt -X POST localhost:8080/auth/login -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{"email":"지안@id.com", "password":"toomanysecrets"}'

{"id":"639bb9d644416bf7278dde44"}


➜  curl -b cookie.txt localhost:8080/user/me

{"email":"지안@id.com"}
```

# WebSocket

![webSocket](webServicesWebSocketsLogo.png)

HTTP is based on a client server architecture. A client always initiates the request and the server responds. This is great if you are building a global document library connected by hyperlinks, but for many other use cases it just doesn't work. Applications for notifications, distributed task processing, peer to peer communication, or asynchronous events need communication that is initiated by two or more connected devices.

For years, web developers created hacks to work around the limitation of the client/server model. This included solutions like having the client frequently pinging the server to see if the server had anything to say, or keeping client initiated connections open for a very long time as the client waited for some event to happen on the server. Needless to say, none of these solutions were elegant or efficient.

Finally, in 2011 the communication protocol WebSocket was created to solve this problem. The core feature of WebSocket is that it is fully duplexed. Meaning that after the initial connection is made from a client, using vanilla HTTP, and then upgraded by the server to a WebSocket connection, the relationship changes to a peer to peer connection where either party can efficiently send data at any time.

![WebSocket Upgrade](webServicesWebSocketUpgrade.jpg)

WebSocket connections are still only between two parties. So if you want to facilitate a conversation between a group of users the server must act as the intermediary. Each peer first connects to the server, and then the server forwards messages amongst the peers.

![WebSocket Peers](webServicesWebSocketPeers.jpg)

## Creating a WebSocket conversation

JavaScript running on a browser can initiate a websocket connection with the browser's WebSocket API. First you create a WebSocket object by specifying the port you want to communicate on.

You can then send messages with the `send` function, and register a callback using the `onmessage` function to receive messages.

```js
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:9900');

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('received: ', event.data);
};

socket.send('I am listening');
```

The server uses the `ws` package to create a WebSocketServer that is listening on the same port the browser is using. By specifying a port when you create the WebSocketServer you are telling the server to listen for HTTP connections on that port and to automatically upgrade them to a WebSocket connection if the request has a `connection: Upgrade` header.

When a connection is detected it calls the server's `on connection` callback. The server can then send messages with the `send` function, and register a callback using the `on message` function to receive messages.

```js
const { WebSocketServer } = require('ws');

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 9900 });

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  ws.on('message', (data) => {
    const msg = String.fromCharCode(...data);
    console.log('received: %s', msg);

    ws.send(`I heard you say "${msg}"`);
  });

  ws.send('Hello webSocket');
});
```

In later instruction we will show you how to run and debug this example.

# WebSocket chat

With the understanding of what WebSockets are, the basics of using them from Node and the browser, and the ability to debug the communication, it is time to use WebSocket to build a simple chat application.

![WebSocket Peers](webServicesWebSocketPeers.jpg)

In this example we will create an HTML page that uses WebSockets and displays the resulting chat. The server will forward the WebSocket communication from the different clients.

## Chat client

The HTML for the client provides an input for the user's name, an input for creating messages, and an element to display the messages that are sent and received.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>WebSocket Chat</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="name">
      <fieldset id="name-controls">
        <legend>My Name</legend>
        <input id="my-name" type="text" />
      </fieldset>
    </div>

    <fieldset id="chat-controls" disabled>
      <legend>Chat</legend>
      <input id="new-msg" type="text" />
      <button onclick="sendMessage()">Send</button>
    </fieldset>
    <div id="chat-text"></div>
  </body>
  <script src="chatClient.js"></script>
</html>
```

The JavaScript for the application provides the interaction with the DOM for creating and displaying messages, and manages the WebSockets in order to connect, send, and receive messages.

### DOM interaction

We do not want to be able to send messages if the user has not specified a name. So we add an event listener on the name input and disable the chat controls if the name ever is empty.

```js
const chatControls = document.querySelector('#chat-controls');
const myName = document.querySelector('#my-name');
myName.addEventListener('keyup', (e) => {
  chatControls.disabled = myName.value === '';
});
```

We then create a function that will update the displayed messages by selecting the element with the `chat-text` ID and appending the new message to its HTML. Security minded developers will realize that manipulating the DOM in this way will allow any chat user execute code in the context of the application. After you get everything working, if you are interested, see if you can exploit this weakness.

```js
function appendMsg(cls, from, msg) {
  const chatText = document.querySelector('#chat-text');
  chatText.innerHTML = `<div><span class="${cls}">${from}</span>: ${msg}</div>` + chatText.innerHTML;
}
```

When a user presses the enter key in the message input we want to send the message over the socket. We do this by selecting the DOM element with the `new-msg` ID and adding a listener that watches for the `Enter` keystroke.

```js
const input = document.querySelector('#new-msg');
input.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
  if (e.key === 'Enter') {
    sendMessage();
  }
});
```

When Enter is pressed the sendMessage function is called. This selects the text out of the `new-msg` element and the name out of the `my-name` element and sends that over the WebSocket. The value of the message element is then cleared so that it is ready for the next message.

```js
function sendMessage() {
  const msgEl = document.querySelector('#new-msg');
  const msg = msgEl.value;
  if (!!msg) {
    appendMsg('me', 'me', msg);
    const name = document.querySelector('#my-name').value;
    socket.send(`{"name":"${name}", "msg":"${msg}"}`);
    msgEl.value = '';
  }
}
```

### WebSocket connection

Now we can set up our WebSocket. We want to be able to support both secure and non-secure WebSocket connections. To do this we look at the protocol that is currently being used as represented by the `window.location.protocol` variable. If it is non-secure HTTP then we set our WebSocket protocol to be non-secure WebSocket (`ws`). Otherwise we use secure WebSocket (`wss`). We use that to then connect the WebSocket to the same location that we loaded the HTML from by referencing the `window.location.host` variable.

We can notify the user that chat is ready to go by listening to the `onopen` event and appending some text to the display using the `appendMsg` function we created earlier.

```js
// Adjust the webSocket protocol to what is being used for HTTP
const protocol = window.location.protocol === 'http:' ? 'ws' : 'wss';
const socket = new WebSocket(`${protocol}://${window.location.host}/ws`);

// Display that we have opened the webSocket
socket.onopen = (event) => {
  appendMsg('system', 'websocket', 'connected');
};
```

When the WebSocket receives a message from a peer it displays it using the `appendMsg` function.

```js
socket.onmessage = async (event) => {
  const text = await event.data.text();
  const chat = JSON.parse(text);
  appendMsg('friend', chat.name, chat.msg);
};
```

And if the WebSocket closes for any reason we also display that to the user and disable the controls.

```js
socket.onclose = (event) => {
  appendMsg('system', 'websocket', 'disconnected');
  document.querySelector('#name-controls').disabled = true;
  document.querySelector('#chat-controls').disabled = true;
};
```

## Chat server

The chat server runs the web service, serves up the client code, manages the WebSocket connections, and forwards messages from the peers.

### Web service

The web service is established using a simple Express application. Note that we serve up our client HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files using the `static` middleware.

```js
const { WebSocketServer } = require('ws');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Serve up our webSocket client HTML
app.use(express.static('./public'));

const port = process.argv.length > 2 ? process.argv[2] : 3000;
server = app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Listening on ${port}`);
});
```

### WebSocket server

When we create our WebSocket we do things a little differently than we did with the simple connection example. Instead of letting the WebSocketServer control both the HTTP connection and the upgrading to WebSocket, we want to use the HTTP connection that Express is providing and handle the upgrade to WebSocket ourselves. This is done by specifying the `noServer` option when creating the WebSocketServer and then handling the `upgrade` notification that occurs when a client requests the upgrade of the protocol from HTTP to WebSocket.

```js
// Create a websocket object
const wss = new WebSocketServer({ noServer: true });

// Handle the protocol upgrade from HTTP to WebSocket
server.on('upgrade', (request, socket, head) => {
  wss.handleUpgrade(request, socket, head, function done(ws) {
    wss.emit('connection', ws, request);
  });
});
```

### Forwarding messages

With the WebSocket server we can use the `connection`, `message`, and `close` events to forward messages between peers. On connection we insert an object representing the connection into a list of all connections from the chat peers. Then when a message is received we loop through the peer connections and forward it on to everyone except the peer who initiated the request. Finally we remove a connection from the peer connection list when it is closed.

```js
// Keep track of all the connections so we can forward messages
let connections = [];

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  const connection = { id: connections.length + 1, alive: true, ws: ws };
  connections.push(connection);

  // Forward messages to everyone except the sender
  ws.on('message', function message(data) {
    connections.forEach((c) => {
      if (c.id !== connection.id) {
        c.ws.send(data);
      }
    });
  });

  // Remove the closed connection so we don't try to forward anymore
  ws.on('close', () => {
    connections.findIndex((o, i) => {
      if (o.id === connection.id) {
        connections.splice(i, 1);
        return true;
      }
    });
  });
});
```

### Keeping connections alive

A WebSocket connection will eventually close automatically if no data is sent across it. In order to prevent that from happening the WebSocket protocol supports the ability to send a `ping` message to see if the peer is still there and receive `pong` responses to indicate the affirmative.

It make this work we use `setInterval` to send out a ping every 10 seconds to each of our peer connections and clean up any connections that did not response to our previous ping.

```js
setInterval(() => {
  connections.forEach((c) => {
    // Kill any connection that didn't respond to the ping last time
    if (!c.alive) {
      c.ws.terminate();
    } else {
      c.alive = false;
      c.ws.ping();
    }
  });
}, 10000);
```

In our `connection` handler we listen for the `pong` response and mark the connection as alive.

```js
// Respond to pong messages by marking the connection alive
ws.on('pong', () => {
  connection.alive = true;
});
```

Any connection that did not response will remain in the not alive state and get cleaned up on the next pass.
